    "text": "Section 1  Basic Considerations in \nInfectious Diseases\n\n119\n\nApproach to the Patient \nwith an Infectious Disease\nNeeraj K. Surana, Dennis L. Kasper\n\n \u25a0 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\nThe origins of the field of infectious diseases are humble. The notion \nthat communicable diseases were due to a miasma (\u201cbad air\u201d) can be \ntraced back to at least the mid-sixteenth century. Not until the work \nof Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch in the late nineteenth century was \nthere  credible  evidence  supporting  the  germ  theory  of  disease\u2014i.e., \nthat  microorganisms  are  the  direct  cause  of  infections.  In  contrast \nto  this  relatively  slow  start,  the  twentieth  century  saw  remarkable \nadvances in the field of infectious diseases, and the etiologic agents of \nnumerous  infectious  diseases  were  soon  identified.  Furthermore,  the \ndiscovery of antibiotics and the advent of vaccines against some of the \nmost  deadly  and  debilitating  infections  greatly  altered  the  landscape \nof  human  health.  Indeed,  the  twentieth  century  saw  the  elimination \nof  smallpox,  one  of  the  great  scourges  in  the  history  of  humanity. \nThese remarkable successes prompted Sir Frank MacFarlane Burnet, a \nnoted immunologist and Nobel laureate, to write in a 1962 publication \nentitled Natural History of Infectious Diseases: \u201cIn many ways one can \nthink of the middle of the twentieth century as the end of one of the \nmost important social revolutions in history, the virtual elimination of \ninfectious disease.\u201d Professor Burnet was not alone in this view. Robert \nPetersdorf, a renowned infectious disease expert and former editor of \nthis textbook, wrote in 1978 that \u201ceven with my great personal loyalties \nto  infectious  diseases,  I  cannot  conceive  a  need  for  309  more  [grad-\nuating  trainees  in  infectious  diseases]  unless  they  spend  their  time \nculturing  each  other.\u201d  Given  the  enormous  growth  of  interest  in  the \nmicrobiome in the past 15 years, Dr. Petersdorf \u2019s statement might have \nbeen ironically clairvoyant, although he could have had no idea what \nwas  in  store  for  humanity,  with  an  onslaught  of  new,  emerging,  and \nreemerging infectious diseases.\n\nClearly,  even  with  all  the  advances  of  the  twentieth  century, \ninfectious  diseases  continue  to  represent  a  formidable  challenge  for \npatients  and  physicians  alike.  Furthermore,  during  the  latter  half  of \nthe century, several chronic diseases were demonstrated to be directly \nor indirectly caused by infectious microbes; perhaps the most notable \nexamples are the associations of Helicobacter pylori with peptic ulcer \ndisease  and  gastric  carcinoma,  human  papillomavirus  with  cervical \ncancer, and hepatitis B and C viruses with liver cancer. In fact, ~16% \nof all malignancies are now known to be associated with an infectious \ncause.  In  addition,  numerous  emerging  and  reemerging  infectious \ndiseases continue to have a dire impact on global health: HIV/AIDS,  \nSARS-CoV-2,  Ebola,  and  Zika  are  but  a  few  examples.  The  fear  of \nweaponizing  pathogens  for  bioterrorism  is  ever  present  and  poses  a \npotentially enormous threat to public health. Moreover, escalating anti-\nmicrobial resistance in clinically relevant microbes (e.g., carbapenem- \nresistant  Enterobacteriaceae  and  Acinetobacter  spp.,  Candida  auris, \ndrug-resistant  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  and  vancomycin-resistant \nenterococci) signifies that the administration of antimicrobial agents\u2014\nonce thought to be a panacea\u2014requires appropriate stewardship. For \nall these reasons, infectious diseases continue to exert grim effects on \nindividual patients as well as on international public health. Even with \nall the successes of the past century, physicians must be as thoughtful \nabout  infectious  diseases  now  as  they  were  at  the  beginning  of  the \ntwentieth century.\n\nInfectious Diseases\n\nPART 5\n\n \u25a0 GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS\nInfectious diseases remain the second leading cause of death worldwide. \nAlthough the rate of infectious disease\u2013related deaths has decreased dra-\nmatically over the past 25 years, there were still 10.3 million such deaths \nin 2017 (Fig. 119-1A). These deaths disproportionately affect children \n<1 year of age, adults older than 70 years, and persons living in low- and \nmiddle-income  countries  (Fig.  119-1B  and  119-1C;  Chap.  474);  in \n2017, ~18% of all deaths worldwide were related to infectious diseases, \nwith a rate as high as ~58% in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nGiven that infectious diseases are still a major cause of global mor-\ntality,  understanding  the  local  epidemiology  of  disease  is  critically \nimportant  in  evaluating  patients.  Diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS  have \ndecimated  sub-Saharan  Africa,  with  HIV-infected  adults  represent-\ning  20\u201323%  of  the  total  population  in  countries  like  South  Africa, \nBotswana, and Lesotho. Moreover, drug-resistant tuberculosis is ram-\npant  throughout  the  former  Soviet-bloc  countries,  India,  China,  and \nSouth Africa. The ready availability of this type of information allows \nphysicians to develop appropriate differential diagnoses and treatment \nplans for individual patients. Programs such as the Global Burden of \nDisease seek to quantify human losses (e.g., deaths, disability-adjusted \nlife-years) due to diseases by age, sex, and country over time; these data \nnot only help inform local, national, and international health policy but \ncan also help guide local medical decision-making.\n\nEven though some diseases (e.g., pandemic influenza, Middle East \nrespiratory  syndrome)  are  seemingly  geographically  restricted,  the \nincreasing  ease  of  rapid  worldwide  travel  has  raised  concern  about \ntheir  swift  spread  around  the  globe.  Indeed,  human  migration  has \nhistorically been the source of epidemics: Yersinia pestis spread along \ntrade  routes  in  the  fourteenth  century,  Native  American  populations \nwere  devastated  by  diseases  such  as  smallpox  and  measles  that  were \nimported by European explorers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centu-\nries, military maneuvers helped facilitate the spread of the 1918 influ-\nenza pandemic, and religious pilgrimages (e.g., the Hajj) provide the \nmeans for worldwide dissemination of diseases. The continued effects \nof  global  travel  on  the  spread  of  infectious  diseases  are  perhaps  best \nhighlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Chap. 199). Although this \nvirus was first identified in Wuhan, China, it quickly spread across the \nglobe and brought an abrupt end to virtually all travel and commerce \nthroughout the world, plunging economies into a deep recession, and \nresulting at one point in over half the world\u2019s population living under \nstay-at-home  orders.  Not  only  can  travelers  carry  person-to-person \ntransmitted  infections  (e.g.,  influenza,  HIV)  anywhere  in  the  world, \nbut they can also introduce vector-borne infections to new geographic \nareas (e.g., chikungunya and Zika viruses) and contribute to the world-\nwide spread of multidrug-resistant organisms. The world\u2019s increasing \ninterconnectedness has profound implications not only for the global \neconomy but also for medicine and the spread of infectious diseases.\n\n \u25a0 UNDERSTANDING THE MICROBIOTA\nNormal, healthy humans are colonized with ~50 trillion bacteria as well \nas  countless  viruses,  fungi,  and  archaea;  taken  together,  these  micro-\norganisms  outnumber  human  cells  by  ~10  times  in  the  human  body \n(Chap. 471). The major reservoir of these microbes is the gastrointesti-\nnal tract, but substantial numbers of microbes live in the female genital \ntract, the oral cavity, and the nasopharynx. There is increasing interest in \nthe skin and lungs as sites where microbial colonization might be highly \nrelevant to the biology and disease susceptibility of the host. These com-\nmensal organisms provide the host with myriad benefits, from aiding in \nmetabolism  to  shaping  the  immune  system.  With  regard  to  infectious \ndiseases, the vast majority of infections are caused by organisms that are \npart of the normal microbiota (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus \npneumoniae,  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa),  with  relatively  few  infections \ndue to organisms that are strictly pathogens (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, \nrabies virus). Perhaps it is not surprising that a general understanding \nof  the  microbiota  is  essential  in  the  evaluation  of  infectious  diseases. \n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   941\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\n"

Site-specific \nknowledge  of  the  indigenous  microbiota  may  facilitate  appropriate \ninterpretation of culture results, aid in selection of empirical antimicro-\nbial therapy based on the likely causative agents, and provide additional \nimpetus for rational antibiotic use to minimize the untoward effects of \nthese drugs on the \u201cbeneficial\u201d microbes that inhabit the body.\n\n \u25a0 WHEN TO CONSIDER AN INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY\nThe title of this chapter may appear to presuppose that the physician \nknows when a patient has an infectious disease. In reality, this chapter \ncan  serve  only  as  a  guide  to  the  evaluation  of  a  patient  in  whom  an \ninfectious  disease  is  a  possibility.  Once  a  specific  diagnosis  is  made, \nthe reader should consult the subsequent chapters that deal with spe-\ncific  microorganisms  in  detail.  The  challenge  for  the  physician  is  to \nrecognize which patients may have an infectious disease as opposed to \nsome other underlying disorder. This task is greatly complicated by the \nfact that infections have an infinite range of presentations, from acute \nlife-threatening  conditions  (e.g.,  meningococcemia)  to  chronic  dis-\neases of varying severity (e.g., H. pylori\u2013associated peptic ulcer disease) \nto no symptoms at all (e.g., latent M. tuberculosis infection). While it \nis impossible to generalize about a presentation that encompasses all \ninfections, common findings in the history, physical examination, and \n\nbasic  laboratory  testing  often  suggest  that  the  patient  either  has  an \ninfectious  disease  or  should  be  more  closely  evaluated  for  one.  This \nchapter focuses on these common findings and how they may direct \nthe ongoing evaluation of the patient.\n\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT\nInfectious Disease\n\nSee also Chap. 122. \nHISTORY\nAs  in  all  of  medicine,  a  complete  and  thorough  history  is  para-\nmount  in  the  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  a  possible  infectious \ndisease. The history is critical for developing a focused differential \ndiagnosis and for guiding the physical exam and initial diagnostic \ntesting.  Although  a  detailing  of  all  the  elements  of  a  history  is \nbeyond the scope of this chapter, specific components relevant to \ninfectious  diseases  require  particular  attention.  In  general,  these \naspects focus on two areas: (1) an exposure history that may iden-\ntify  microorganisms  with  which  the  patient  may  have  come  into \ncontact  and  (2)  host-specific  factors  that  may  predispose  to  the \ndevelopment of an infection. \n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   942\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\nPART 5Infectious Diseases \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

    "text": "Exposure  History  \u2022\u2003 History  of  infections  or  exposure  to \ndrug-resistant microbes \nInformation about a patient\u2019s previous \ninfections,  with  the  associated  microbial  susceptibility  profiles,  is \nvery  helpful  in  determining  possible  etiologic  agents.  Specifically, \nknowing  whether  a  patient  has  a  history  of  infection  with  drug- \nresistant organisms (e.g., methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin- \nresistant  Enterococcus  species,  enteric  organisms  that  produce  an \nextended-spectrum  \u03b2-lactamase  or  carbapenemase)  or  may  have \nbeen exposed to drug-resistant microbes (e.g., during a recent stay \nin a hospital, nursing home, or long-term acute-care facility) may \nalter  the  choice  of  empirical  antibiotics.  For  example,  a  patient \npresenting with sepsis who is known to have a history of invasive \ninfection with a multidrug-resistant isolate of P. aeruginosa should \nbe treated empirically with an antimicrobial regimen that will cover \nthis strain. \nSocial history  Although the social history taken by physicians \nis  often  limited  to  inquiries  about  a  patient\u2019s  alcohol  and  tobacco \nuse,  a  complete  social  history  can  offer  a  number  of  clues  to  the \nunderlying diagnosis. Knowing whether the patient has any high-\nrisk behaviors (e.g., unsafe sexual behaviors, intravenous [IV] drug \nuse),  potential  hobby-associated  exposures  (e.g.,  avid  gardening, \nwith possible Sporothrix schenckii exposure), or occupational expo-\nsures  (e.g.,  increased  risk  for  M.  tuberculosis  exposure  in  funeral \nservice  workers)  can  facilitate  diagnosis.  The  importance  of  the \nsocial history is exemplified by a case in 2009 in which a laboratory \nresearcher  died  of  a  Y.  pestis  infection  acquired  during  his  work; \nalthough this patient had visited both an outpatient clinic and an \nemergency department, his records at both sites failed to include his \noccupation\u2014information that potentially could have led quickly to \nappropriate treatment and infection control measures. \nDietary  habits  Because  certain  pathogens  are  associated  with \nspecific dietary habits, inquiring about a patient\u2019s diet can provide \ninsight into possible exposures. For example, Shiga toxin\u2013producing \nstrains of Escherichia coli, and Toxoplasma gondii are associated with \nthe  consumption  of  raw  or  undercooked  meat;  Salmonella  typh-\nimurium,  Listeria  monocytogenes,  and  Mycobacterium  bovis  with \nunpasteurized milk; Leptospira species, parasites, and enteric bacte-\nria with unpurified water; and Vibrio species, norovirus, helminths, \nand protozoa with raw seafood. \nAnimal exposures  Because animals are often important vectors \nof infectious diseases, patients should be asked about exposures to \nany animals, including contact with their own pets, visits to petting \nzoos,  or  random  encounters  (e.g.,  home  rodent  infestation).  For \nexample, dogs can carry ticks that serve as agents for the transmis-\nsion of several infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, Rocky \nMountain spotted fever, and ehrlichiosis. Cats are associated with \nBartonella  henselae  infection,  reptiles  with  Salmonella  infection, \nrodents with leptospirosis, and rabbits with tularemia (Chap. 141). \nTravel  history  Attention  should  be  paid  to  both  international \nand domestic travel. Fever in a patient who has recently returned \nfrom  abroad  significantly  broadens  the  differential  diagnosis \n(Chap.  124);  even  a  remote  history  of  international  travel  may \nreflect patients\u2019 exposure to infections with pathogens such as M. \ntuberculosis  or  Strongyloides  stercoralis.  Similarly,  domestic  travel \nmay  have  exposed  patients  to  pathogens  that  are  not  normally \nfound in their local environment and therefore may not routinely \nbe considered in the differential diagnosis. For example, a patient \nwho has recently visited California or Martha\u2019s Vineyard may have \nbeen  exposed  to  Coccidioides  immitis  or  Francisella  tularensis, \nrespectively. Beyond simply identifying locations that a patient may \nhave visited, the physician needs to delve deeper to learn what kinds \nof activities and behaviors the patient engaged in during travel (e.g., \nthe types of food and sources of water consumed, freshwater swim-\nming, animal exposures) and whether the patient had the necessary \nimmunizations and/or took the necessary prophylactic medications \nprior to travel; these additional exposures, which the patient may \n\n943\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n1\n1\n9\n\nA\np\np\nr\no\na\nc\nh\nt\no\nt\nh\ne\nP\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\n\nw\n\ni\nt\nh\na\nn\nI\nn\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nu\ns\nD\ni\ns\ne\na\ns\ne\n\nnot think to report without specific prompting, are as important as \nexposures during a patient\u2019s routine daily living. \nHost-Specific  Factors  Because  many  opportunistic  infections \n(e.g.,  with  Pneumocystis  jirovecii,  Aspergillus  species,  or  JC  virus) \naffect primarily immunocompromised patients, it is of vital impor-\ntance to determine the immune status of the patient. Defects in the \nimmune system may be due to an underlying disease (e.g., malig-\nnancy, HIV infection, malnutrition), a medication (e.g., chemother-\napy, glucocorticoids, monoclonal antibodies to components of the \nimmune system), a treatment modality (e.g., total body irradiation, \nsplenectomy), or a primary immunodeficiency. The type of infection \nfor which the patient is at increased risk varies with the specific type \nof immune defect. In concert with determining whether a patient is \nimmunocompromised for any reason, the physician should review \nthe  immunization  record  to  ensure  that  the  patient  is  adequately \nprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases (Chap. 123). \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nLike  the  history,  a  thorough  physical  examination  is  crucial  in \nevaluating patients with an infectious disease. Some elements of the \nphysical exam (e.g., skin, lymphatics) that are often performed in a \ncursory manner as a result of the ever-increasing pace of medical \npractice  may  help  identify  the  underlying  diagnosis.  Moreover, \nserial exams are critical since new findings may appear as the illness \nprogresses. A description of all the elements of a physical exam is \nbeyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter,  but  the  following  components \nhave particular relevance to infectious diseases. \n\nVital Signs  Given that elevations in temperature are often a hall-\nmark  of  infection,  paying  close  attention  to  the  temperature  may \nbe of value in diagnosing an infectious disease. The idea that 37\u00b0C \n(98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the \nnineteenth  century  and  was  initially  based  on  axillary  measure-\nments.  Rectal  temperatures  more  accurately  reflect  the  core  body \ntemperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral \nand axillary temperatures, respectively. This idea of a \u201cnormal\u201d body \ntemperature does not take into account the fact that temperatures \ntend to be higher later in the day, in women, and in younger people. \nMoreover,  the  average  body  temperature  seems  to  have  dropped \n~0.03\u00b0C  every  decade  since  the  early  1800s  to  a  new  normal  of \n~36.7\u00b0C. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout \nthe medical literature, the most common definition, which is based \non studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 20), uses a core \ntemperature  \u226538.3\u00b0C  (\u2265101\u00b0F).  Although  fever  is  very  commonly \nassociated  with  infection,  it  is  also  documented  in  many  other \ndiseases (Chap. 18). For every 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) increase in core temper-\nature, the heart rate typically rises by 15\u201320 beats/min. Table 119-1 \nlists infections that are associated with relative bradycardia (Faget\u2019s \nsign), where patients have a lower heart rate than might be expected \nfor  a  given  body  temperature.  Although  this  pulse\u2013temperature \ndissociation  is  not  highly  sensitive  or  specific  for  establishing  a \ndiagnosis, it is potentially useful in low-resource settings given its \nready availability and simplicity. \n\nLymphatics  There  are  ~600  lymph  nodes  throughout  the  body, \nand  infections  are  an  important  cause  of  lymphadenopathy.  A \nphysical  examination  should  include  evaluation  of  lymph  nodes \nin  multiple  regions  (e.g.,  popliteal,  inguinal,  epitrochlear,  axillary, \nmultiple cervical regions), with notation of the location, size (nor-\nmal,  <1  cm),  presence  or  absence  of  tenderness,  and  consistency \n(soft, firm, or rubbery) and of whether the nodes are matted (i.e., \nconnected  and  moving  together).  Nodes  that  are  small  and  firm \ncan also be described as \u201cshotty,\u201d referring to the size and consis-\ntency of buckshot pellets. Of note, palpable epitrochlear nodes are \nalways  pathologic.  Of  patients  presenting  with  lymphadenopathy,   \n75% have localized findings, and the remaining 25% have general-\nized lymphadenopathy (i.e., that involving more than one anatomic \nregion). Localized lymphadenopathy in the head and neck region is \n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   943\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Determining whether the patient \nhas generalized versus localized lymphadenopathy can help narrow \nthe differential diagnosis, as various infections present differently. \nSkin  The fact that many infections have cutaneous manifestations \ngives the skin examination particular importance in the evaluation \nof patients (Chaps. 19, 58, 129, and A1). It is important to perform \na complete skin exam, with attention to both front and back. Spe-\ncific rashes are often extremely helpful in narrowing the differential \ndiagnosis of an infection (Chaps. 19 and A1). In numerous anec-\ndotal instances, patients in the intensive care unit have had \u201cfever \nof unknown origin\u201d that was actually due to unrecognized pressure \nulcers.  Moreover,  close  examination  of  the  distal  extremities  for \nsplinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, or Osler\u2019s nodes may yield \nevidence of endocarditis or other causes of septic emboli. \nForeign  Bodies  As  previously  mentioned,  many  infections  are \ncaused by members of the indigenous microbiota. These infections \ntypically  occur  when  these  microbes  escape  their  normal  habitat \nand  enter  a  new  one.  Thus,  maintenance  of  epithelial  barriers \nis  one  of  the  most  important  mechanisms  in  protection  against \ninfection.  However,  hospitalization  of  patients  is  often  associated \nwith breaches of these barriers\u2014e.g., due to placement of IV lines, \nsurgical drains, or tubes (e.g., endotracheal tubes and Foley cathe-\nters)  that  allow  microorganisms  to  localize  in  sites  to  which  they \nnormally would not have access (Chap. 142). Accordingly, knowing \nwhat lines, tubes, and drains are in place is helpful in ascertaining \nwhat body sites might be infected. \nDIAGNOSTIC TESTING\nLaboratory  and  radiologic  testing  has  advanced  greatly  over  the \npast few decades and has become an important component in the \nevaluation of patients. The dramatic increase in the number of sero-\nlogic diagnostics, antigen tests, and molecular diagnostics available \nto the physician has, in fact, revolutionized medical care. However, \nall  of  these  tests  should  be  viewed  as  adjuncts  to  the  history  and \nphysical  examination\u2014not  a  replacement  for  them.  The  selection \n\nof initial tests should be based directly on the patient\u2019s history and \nphysical  exam  findings.  Moreover,  diagnostic  testing  should  gen-\nerally be limited to those conditions that are reasonably likely and \ntreatable, important in terms of public health considerations, and/\nor capable of providing a definitive diagnosis that will consequently \nlimit other testing. \nWhite Blood Cell (WBC) Count  Elevations in the WBC count are \noften  associated  with  infection,  though  many  viral  infections  are \nassociated with leukopenia. It is important to assess the WBC dif-\nferential, given that different classes of microbes are associated with \nvarious leukocyte types. For example, bacteria are associated with \nan increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils, often with elevated \nlevels  of  earlier  developmental  forms  such  as  bands;  viruses  are \nassociated  with  an  increase  in  lymphocytes;  and  certain  parasites \nare associated with an increase in eosinophils. Table 119-2 lists the \nmajor infectious causes of eosinophilia. \nInflammatory Markers  The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) \nand  the  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  level  are  indirect  and  direct \nmeasures  of  the  acute-phase  response,  respectively,  that  can  be \nused to assess a patient\u2019s general level of inflammation. Moreover, \nthese markers can be followed serially over time to monitor disease \nprogress/resolution. It is noteworthy that the ESR changes relatively \nslowly, and its measurement more often than weekly usually is not \nuseful;  in  contrast,  CRP  concentrations  change  rapidly,  and  daily \nmeasurements can be useful in the appropriate context. Although \nthese  markers  are  sensitive  indicators  of  inflammation,  neither  is \nvery specific. An extremely elevated ESR (>100 mm/h) has a 90% \npredictive  value  for  a  serious  underlying  disease  (Table  119-3). \nWork is ongoing to identify other potentially useful inflammatory \nmarkers  (e.g.,  procalcitonin,  serum  amyloid  A  protein);  however, \ntheir clinical utility requires further validation. \nAnalysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)  Assessment of CSF is criti-\ncal for patients with suspected meningitis or encephalitis. An open-\ning pressure should always be recorded, and fluid should routinely \nbe sent for cell counts, Gram\u2019s stain and culture, and determination \nof glucose and protein levels. A CSF Gram\u2019s stain typically requires \n>105  bacteria/mL  for  reliable  positivity;  its  specificity  approaches \n100%. Table 119-4 lists the typical CSF profiles for various infec-\ntions.  In  general,  CSF  with  lymphocytic  pleocytosis  and  a  low \nglucose concentration suggests either infection (e.g., with Listeria, \nM.  tuberculosis,  or  a  fungus)  or  a  noninfectious  disorder  (e.g., \nneoplastic  meningitis,  sarcoidosis).  Bacterial  antigen  tests  of  CSF   \n(e.g.,  latex  agglutination  tests  for  Haemophilus  influenzae  type  b, \ngroup  B  Streptococcus,  S.  pneumoniae,  and  Neisseria  meningitidis) \nare  not  recommended  for  screening,  given  that  these  tests  are  no \nmore sensitive than Gram\u2019s stain; however, these assays can be help-\nful  in  presumptively  identifying  organisms  seen  on  Gram\u2019s  stain. \nIn  contrast,  other  antigen  tests  (e.g.,  for  Cryptococcus)  and  some \nCSF  serologic  testing  (e.g.,  for  Treponema  pallidum,  Coccidioides) \nare highly sensitive and are useful for select patients. In addition, \npolymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  analysis  of  CSF  is  increasingly \nbeing  used  for  the  diagnosis  of  bacterial  (e.g.,  N.  meningitidis,  S. \npneumoniae,  mycobacteria)  and  viral  (e.g.,  herpes  simplex  virus, \nenterovirus)  infections;  while  these  molecular  tests  permit  rapid \ndiagnosis with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, they often \ndo not allow determination of antimicrobial resistance profiles. \nCultures  The  mainstays  of  infectious  disease  diagnosis  include \nthe culture of infected tissue (e.g., surgical specimens) or fluid (e.g., \nblood, urine, sputum, pus from a wound). Samples can be sent for \nculture of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic), fungi, or viruses. Ideally, \nspecimens are collected before the administration of antimicrobial \ntherapy;  in  instances  where  this  order  of  events  is  not  clinically \nfeasible,  microscopic  examination  of  the  specimen  (e.g.,  Gram-\nstained  or  potassium  hydroxide  [KOH]\u2013treated  preparations)  is \nparticularly important. Culture of the organism(s) allows identifi-\ncation of the etiologic agent(s), determination of the antimicrobial \n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   944\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\nPART 5Infectious Diseases\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

While cultures are extremely useful in the \nevaluation of patients, determining whether culture results are clin-\nically  meaningful  or  represent  contamination  (e.g.,  a  non-aureus, \nnon-lugdunensis staphylococcal species growing in a blood culture) \ncan sometimes be challenging and requires an understanding of the \npatient\u2019s immune status, exposure history, and microbiota. In some \ncases, serial cultures to demonstrate clearance of the organism may \nbe helpful. \n\nPathogen-Specific  Testing  Numerous  pathogen-specific  tests \n(e.g., serology, antigen testing, PCR testing) are commercially avail-\nable,  and  many  hospitals  now  offer  some  of  these  tests  in-house \nto  facilitate  rapid  turnaround  that  ultimately  enhances  patient \ncare. The reader is directed to relevant chapters on the pathogens \n\nof  interest  for  specific  details.

When clinically feasible, it \nis best to obtain relevant samples (e.g., blood, CSF, tissue, purulent \nexudate)  for  culture  prior  to  the  administration  of  antibiotics,  as \nantibiotic treatment often makes subsequent diagnosis more difficult. \nAlthough a general maxim for antibiotic treatment is to use a regi-\nmen with as narrow a spectrum as possible (Chap. 144), empirical \nregimens are necessarily somewhat broad, given that a specific diag-\nnosis has not yet been made. Table 119-5 lists empirical antibiotic \ntreatment regimens for commonly encountered infectious presen-\ntations. These regimens should be narrowed as appropriate once a \nspecific diagnosis is made. In addition to antibiotics, there is some-\ntimes  a  role  for  adjunctive  therapies,  such  as  intravenous  immu-\nnoglobulin G (IVIG) pooled from healthy adults or hyperimmune \n\nglobulin  prepared  from  the  blood  of  individuals  with  high  titers \nof  specific  antibodies  to  select  pathogens  (e.g.,  cytomegalovirus, \nhepatitis  B  virus,  rabies  virus,  vaccinia  virus,  Clostridium  tetani, \nvaricella-zoster virus, Clostridium botulinum toxin). Although the \ndata  suggesting  efficacy  are  limited,  IVIG  is  sometimes  used  for \npatients with suspected staphylococcal or streptococcal toxic shock \nsyndrome. \nINFECTION CONTROL\nWhen evaluating a patient with a suspected infectious disease, the \nphysician must consider what infection control methods are neces-\nsary to prevent transmission of any possible infection to other peo-\nple. In 2007, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \npublished guidelines for isolation precautions that are available for \ndownload  at  www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.\nhtml.  Persons  exposed  to  certain  pathogens  (e.g.,  N.  meningitidis, \nHIV,  Bacillus  anthracis)  should  receive  postexposure  prophylaxis \nto prevent disease acquisition. (See relevant chapters for details on \nspecific pathogens.) \nWHEN TO OBTAIN AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULT\nAt times, primary physicians need assistance with patient manage-\nment  from  a  diagnostic  and/or  therapeutic  perspective.  Multiple \nstudies  have  demonstrated  that  an  infectious  disease  consult  is \nassociated with improved outcomes, shorter length of hospital stay, \nand decreased costs for patients with various diseases. For example, \nin a prospective cohort study of patients with S. aureus bacteremia, \ninfectious disease consultation was independently associated with a \n56%  reduction  in  28-day  mortality.  In  addition,  infectious  disease \nspecialists  provide  other  services  (e.g.,  infection  control,  antimi-\ncrobial  stewardship,  management  of  outpatient  antibiotic  therapy, \noccupational exposure programs) that have been shown to benefit \npatients.  Whenever  such  assistance  would  be  advantageous  to  a \npatient  with  a  possible  infection,  the  primary  physician  should \nopt for an infectious disease consult. Specific situations that might \nprompt a consult include (1) difficult-to-diagnose patients with pre-\nsumed infections, (2) patients who are not responding to treatment \nas  expected,  (3)  patients  with  a  complicated  medical  history  (e.g., \norgan transplant recipients, patients immunosuppressed due to auto-\nimmune or inflammatory conditions), and (4) patients with \u201cexotic\u201d \ndiseases (i.e., diseases that are not typically seen within the region).\n\nTABLE 119-4  Typical Cerebrospinal Fluid Profiles for Meningitis and Encephalitisa\nFUNGAL \nBACTERIAL \nMENINGITISb\nMENINGITIS\n40\u2013600\n>1000\n\nVIRAL \nMENINGITIS\n25\u2013500\n\nNORMAL\n<5\n\nWBC count (per \n\u03bcL)\nDifferential of WBC 60\u201370% \n\nlymphocytes, \n\u226430% monocytes/\nmacrophages\nNegative\n\nGram\u2019s stain\n\nGlucose (mg/dL)\n\n40\u201385\n\n15\u201345\n50\u2013180\n\nProtein (mg/dL)\nOpening pressure \n(mmH2O)\nCommon causes \u2014\n\nLymphocytes or \nPMNs, depending \non specific \norganism\nRarely positive\n\n\u2193 to normal\n\n150\u2013300\n160\u2013340\n\n\u2191\u2191PMNs (\u226580%)\n\nPredominantly \nlymphocytesc\n\nNegative\n\nNormal\n\n20\u201380\n100\u2013350\n\nPositive (in >60% \nof cases)\n<40\n\n>100\n>300\n\nStreptococcus \npneumoniae, \nNeisseria \nmeningitidis\n\nEnteroviruses\n\nCandida, \nCryptococcus, and \nAspergillus spp.\n\nPARASITIC \nMENINGITIS\n150\u20132000\n\nTUBERCULOUS \nMENINGITIS\n25\u2013100\n\nENCEPHALITIS\n50\u2013500\n\n\u2191\u2191 Eosinophils \n(\u226550%)d\n\nPredominantly \nlymphocytesc\n\nPredominantly \nlymphocytesc\n\nNegative\n\nNormal\n\n50\u2013200\nNormal\n\nAngiostrongylus \ncantonensis, \nGnathostoma \nspinigerum, \nBaylisascaris \nprocyonis\n\nOccasionally \npositivee\n<50 in 75% of \ncases\n100\u2013200\n150\u2013280\n\nMycobacterium \ntuberculosis\n\nNegative\n\nNormal\n\n50\u2013100\nNormal to \u2191\n\nHerpesviruses, \nenteroviruses, \ninfluenza virus, \nrabies virus\n\naNumbers indicate typical results, but actual results may vary. bCerebrospinal fluid characteristics depend greatly on the specific organism. cNeutrophils may predominate \nearly in the disease course. dPatients typically have striking eosinophilia as well. eSensitivity can be increased by examination of a smear of protein coagulum (pellicle) and \nthe use of acid-fast stains.\nAbbreviations: PMNs, polymorphonuclear neutrophils; WBC, white blood cell.\n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   946\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\nPART 5Infectious Diseases\u00a0\n"

Given that nearly one-fifth of deaths worldwide are still \nrelated to infectious diseases, it is clear that the war against infectious \ndiseases has not been won.

Goldberg\n\nInfectious diseases of humans involve intricate interactions among the \ninfecting  microbe,  human  tissue,  and  the  host  microbiome.  The  co- \nevolution of humans and microbes has led to the presence of numerous \nand varied specific microbial factors that promote the disease process \nand  a  corresponding  wide  range  of  human  cellular  responses,  both \n\nspecific  and  nonspecific,  to  pathogens.  Among  the  microbial  factors \nthat promote disease are those that alter human cells, those that inhibit \nhost immune responses, and those that respond to the microbes that \nconstitute  the  microbiota  and  their  metabolic  products.  The  process \nof infection can be divided into several stages: the encounter with and \nentry of the microbe into the human body (colonization), the attach-\nment of the microbe in its favored niche and microbial avoidance of \nhost defenses (infection), the combined deployment of microbial fac-\ntors that damage human tissue and host inflammatory responses to the \npresence of the microbe (disease), and the release of the pathogen into \nthe environment, where it can infect others (transmission). It is notable \nthat  for  most  microbial  pathogens,  the  host  inflammatory  response \ncontributes substantially to symptoms and to tissue damage. Moreover, \nthe  human  microbiota  (the  collection  of  microbes  that  reside  in  and \non  the  human  body)  modulates,  directly  or  indirectly,  every  stage  of \ninfection  (Chap.  471).  This  chapter  describes  the  best-understood \nmolecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to human disease \ncaused by bacterial pathogens.\n\nENTRY INTO THE HUMAN HOST\nInfectious diseases occur when either a live pathogen enters the human \nhost or a toxic pathogen product is ingested by the host, with the for-\nmer being much more common than the latter.\n\nMost  bacterial  infections  result  from  entry  of  a  pathogen  into  the \nbody. Entry can occur through a break in the skin into the underlying \nsoft tissues or at the surface of a mucous membrane of the respiratory, \ngastrointestinal,  or  genitourinary  tract;  the  skin  may  also  be  directly \ninfected. Entry at these sites may result in infection of the bloodstream, \nwhich may in turn lead to infection of other organ systems.\n\nEntry  into  the  respiratory  tract  occurs  via  respiratory  droplet \nnuclei (airborne particles 1\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter) or via fomites intro-\nduced on a hand that is contaminated by contact with a contaminated \ninert surface (e.g., a doorknob or a faucet). Infectious droplet nuclei \nare  generated  when  an  individual  with  a  communicable  respira-\ntory  infection  (e.g.,  tuberculosis,  Legionnaires\u2019  disease,  psittacosis, \ninfluenza,  measles,  chickenpox,  aspergillosis,  COVID-19  infection) \nsneezes, coughs, talks, plays a musical instrument by mouth, or sings. \nA cough may generate 3000 particles, whereas a sneeze may generate \nup  to  40,000  particles;  large  particles  may  evaporate  down  to  the \n0.5-  to  12-\u03bcm  range,  and  particles  that  are  1.5  \u03bcm  and  hygroscopic \nincrease  in  size  as  they  pass  through  the  moist  nasal  passages  and \nlower respiratory tree.\n\nEntry into the gastrointestinal tract occurs via ingestion of contam-\ninated  food  or  water  or  via  person-to-person  contact,  typically  with \ntransfer  from  a  contaminated  hand  into  the  mouth.  Pathogens  for \nwhich the infectious inoculum is large (e.g., 108 organisms for epidemic \nspread of Vibrio cholerae, 105 organisms for Salmonella enterica serovar \nTyphimurium) are generally acquired via contaminated food or water, \nwhereas  pathogens  for  which  the  infectious  inoculum  is  small  (e.g., \n101 to 102 organisms for Shigella spp.) are more commonly acquired by \nperson-to-person spread.\n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   948\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\nPART 5Infectious Diseases"

    "text": "Entry  into  the  genitourinary  tract  generally  takes  place  either  via \ncolonization  of  the  urethral  meatus  or  vaginal  introitus  with  fecal \norganisms followed by ascension of the organisms into the bladder or \nkidneys  or  via  instrumentation.  Pyelonephritis  can  also  result  from \nseeding from the bloodstream.\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF INFECTION\n \u25a0 NICHE\nLive Pathogens  Within the human host, many bacterial pathogens \ndisplay tissue tropism; the sites of infection within the human body are \npathogen-specific and restricted, such that even adjacent tissues may \nbe  uninvolved.  For  example,  group  A  streptococci  cause  pharyngitis \nand soft tissue infection, but rarely pneumonia. Cholera is an infection \nof the small intestine, but not the stomach or the colon, where Shigella \nspp.  cause  disease  only  in  the  rectosigmoid.  Therefore,  to  establish \ninfection, the pathogen must access its niche and then remain within \nthat  niche  (Table  120-1).  In  the  respiratory  tree,  the  sites  at  which \npathogens initially settle can be determined by mode of spread. Droplet \nnuclei reach the bronchial tree or alveoli, whereas, after contaminated \nhands  touch  the  face,  fomites  reach  the  pharynx  or  nasal  passages. \nPathogens move through the gastrointestinal tract via normal intestinal \nmotility.\n\nTissue  association  and  invasion  are  dictated  by  the  interaction  of \nthe  bacterium  with  host  factors,  commonly  glycan-decorated  recep-\ntors  and/or  the  associated  extracellular  matrix.  The  environmental \nconditions  of  the  niche  trigger  the  expression  of  virulence  factors \n\nDISEASE\nAnthrax\n\nBACTERIUM\nBacillus anthracis\n\nTABLE 120-1  Bacterial Pathogens, Diseases, and Niches\nMOST COMMON \nTROPISM\nSkin, respiratory tract, \nsmall intestine\nRespiratory tract\nSystemic\nSystemic\nSystemic\n\nBordetella pertussis\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nBrucella abortus\nBurkholderia \npseudomallei\nChlamydia trachomatis\n\nPertussis\nLyme disease\nBrucellosis\nMelioidosis\n\nEyes, venereal\n\nColon\nPharynx\n\nSystemic\nColon\n\nStomach\nRespiratory tract\nSystemic, central \nnervous system\nRespiratory tract\n\nUrogenital tract\nRespiratory tract\n\nSystemic\n\nGastrointestinal tract\n\nColon, rectum\nMultiple sites\nSoft tissue\nSmall intestine\nSystemic\n\nClostridioides difficile\nCorynebacterium \ndiphtheriae\nCoxiella burnetii\nEnterohemorrhagic \nEscherichia coli\nHelicobacter pylori\nLegionella pneumophila\nListeria monocytogenes\n\nMycobacterium \ntuberculosis\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\nPseudomonas \naeruginosa\nSalmonella enterica \nserovar Typhi\nSalmonella enterica \nserovar Typhimurium\nShigella spp.\nStaphylococcus aureus\nGroup A Streptococcus\nVibrio cholerae\nYersinia pestis\n\nVarious chlamydioses, \nincluding trachoma\nColitis\nDiphtheria\n\nQ fever\n\nGastritis, gastric ulcers\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease\nListeriosis\n\nTuberculosis\n\nGonorrhea\n\nTyphoid fever\n\nDysentery, shigellosis\n\nCholera\nPlague\n\n949\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n1\n2\n0\n\nM\no\nl\ne\nc\nu\nl\na\nr\n\nM\ne\nc\nh\na\nn\ni\ns\n\nm\n\ns\no\nf\n\nM\ni\nc\nr\no\nb\ni\na\nl\n\nP\na\nt\nh\no\ng\ne\nn\ne\ns\ni\ns\n\nrequired  for  the  establishment  of  infection;  for  example,  bile  salts  in \nthe gut stimulate the expression of V. cholerae adhesins and toxins and \nthe  germination  of  Clostridioides  difficile  spores.  Bacteria  commonly \nmanipulate  their  particular  niche  environment  in  ways  that  facilitate \ninfection.  For  example,  the  gastroduodenal  pathogen  Helicobacter \npylori  produces  urease,  which  converts  urea  into  ammonia,  thereby \nincreasing  the  pH  of  the  acidic  stomach  environment  and  creating  a \nmore  hospitable  environment  for  its  survival.  This  conversion  also \nconcomitantly alters the physiology of the gastric epithelium.\n\nPreformed  Toxins  A  small  number  of  diseases  are  caused  by \ningestion  in  food  of  preformed  bacterial  toxins.  The  most  common \namong  these  are  Staphylococcus  aureus  enterotoxins,  which  can  be \npresent in prepared foods such as dairy, meat, eggs, salads, and pro-\nduce, and the Bacillus cereus emetic enterotoxin, which is most often \nfound in rice or other starchy food that has been improperly refriger-\nated.  Less  common  but  also  important  is  botulinum  toxin  produced \nby Clostridium botulinum. Preformed toxins cause disease in the small \nintestine (nausea and vomiting) and may cause systemic symptoms.\n\nAlthough the pathogens may be killed when food is cooked, their \ntoxins  are  heat  stable.  S.  aureus  enterotoxins  can  be  strongly  emetic. \nB. cereus produces the heat-stable peptide toxin cereulide, which acts \nas  a  potassium  ionophore  and  induces  emesis.  In  botulism,  a  flaccid \nparalysis caused by botulinum toxin, uptake of the toxin blocks neu-\nrotransmitter release in motor neurons, inhibiting the central nervous \nsystem and resulting in potentially fatal respiratory failure.\n \u25a0 ATTACHMENT\nAttachment of bacteria to host tissue surfaces is a prerequisite for the \npathogen\u2019s  establishment  of  an  infection  and  is  mediated  by  specific \nreceptor\u2013ligand  interactions.  In  this  context,  the  tissue  specificity  of \nthe host cell surface receptor repertoire is a critical factor in delimiting \na pathogen\u2019s niche(s). These physical associations additionally facilitate \nthe  pathogen\u2019s  avoidance  of  host  clearance  mechanisms  (see  \u201cAvoid-\nance  of  Innate  Immune  Responses,\u201d  below)  and  may  contribute  to \nformation of biofilms by the pathogen (see \u201cBiofilms,\u201d below). Because \nadhesion to cellular receptors often triggers cellular signal transduction \nand innate immune signaling, therapeutic blocking of this interaction \nmay in some circumstances exacerbate infection.\n\nAdhesins  Bacterial pathogens have evolved a wide range of strate-\ngies by which to attach to the diverse host cell structures they encoun-\nter. For many bacterial pathogens, ligands or adhesins for specific host \nreceptors  are  known.  Adhesins  comprise  a  wide  variety  of  surface \nstructures, including single proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, lip-\nids, lipoproteins, and multiprotein filamentous complexes that extend \nseveral micrometers from the bacterial surface, each anchored in the \nouter-surface  cell  envelope.  Most  bacteria  produce  multiple  adhesins \nwith varying specificity, enabling the pathogen to interact with multi-\nple receptors, including those on several distinct cell and tissue types \nencountered  during  the  process  of  infection.  These  interactions  are \noften  partially  redundant,  are  serologically  variable,  and  contribute \nadditively or synergistically with other binding interactions.\n\nCommon classes of adhesins are pili (also known as fimbriae), flag-\nella, and autotransporter proteins (Table 120-2). Pili are hairlike exten-\nsions consisting of a polymer of the major pilin subunit capped with \nminor pilins that provide the adherence function of the structure. Pili \nare classified by type and are produced by many gram-negative bacte-\nria and a smaller number of gram-positive bacteria. To date, efforts to \nprevent infection with pilus-based vaccines have been unsuccessful.\n\nTypes of pili include type I, type P, and type IV. Type I pili frequently \nfunction  at  mucosal  surfaces.  For  example,  they  mediate  the  close \nassociation  of  uropathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (UPEC)  with  bladder \nepithelial  cells  and  the  ability  of  this  pathogen  to  persist,  causing \nrelapsing urinary tract infections. UPEC also produces type P pili and \nafimbrial adhesins. These adhesins bind sugar moieties on host surface \nglycoproteins,  with  varied  specificity  depending  on  the  adhesin.  The \nminor  pilin  lectins  at  the  tip  of  the  pili  generally  bind  D-mannose \nglycans,  albeit  with  strain  specificity.  For  example,  the  type  I  pilus \nadhesin  FimH  of  intestinal  E.  coli  strains  often  preferentially  binds \n\nHPIM21e_Part05_p941-p1796.indd   949\n\n20/01/22   6:34 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"
