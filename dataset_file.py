In the care of the suffering, [the \nphysician]  needs  technical  skill,  scientific  knowledge,  and  human  under-\nstanding. Tact, sympathy, and understanding are expected of the physician, \nfor the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered func-\ntions, damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. [The patient] is human, \nfearful, and hopeful, seeking relief, help, and reassurance.\n\n\u2014Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950\n\nThe practice of medicine has changed in significant ways since the first \nedition  of  this  book  was  published  in  1950.  The  advent  of  molecular \ngenetics, sophisticated new imaging techniques, robotics, and advances in \nbioinformatics and information technology have contributed to an explo-\nsion  of  scientific  information  that  has  changed  fundamentally  the  way \nphysicians  define,  diagnose,  treat,  and  attempt  to  prevent  disease.  This \ngrowth of scientific knowledge continues to evolve at an accelerated pace.\nThe widespread use of electronic medical records and the Internet \nhave altered the way physicians and other health care providers access \nand exchange information as a routine part of medical education and \npractice  (Fig.  1-1).  As  today\u2019s  physicians  strive  to  integrate  an  ever-\nexpanding  body  of  scientific  knowledge  into  everyday  practice,  it  is \ncritically important to remember two key principles: first, the ultimate \ngoal of medicine is to prevent disease and, when it occurs, to diagnose \nit early and provide effective treatment; and second, despite 70 years \nof scientific advances since the first edition of this text, a trusting rela-\ntionship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of effective \npatient care.\n\n \u25a0 THE SCIENCE AND ART OF MEDICINE\nDeductive reasoning and applied technology form the foundation for \nthe approach and solution to many clinical problems. Extraordinary \nadvances  in  biochemistry,  cell  biology,  immunology,  and  genomics, \n\nFIGURE 1-1  The Doctor by Luke Fildes depicts the caring relationship between \nthis Victorian physician and a very ill child. Painted in 1891, the painting reflects \nthe death of the painter\u2019s young son from typhoid fever and was intended to reflect \nthe compassionate care provided by the physician even when his tools were not \nable to influence the course of disease.

Revelations about the nature of genes and \nsingle  cells  have  opened  a  portal  for  formulating  a  new  molecular \nbasis  for  the  physiology  of  systems.  Researchers  are  deciphering  the \ncomplex mechanisms by which genes are regulated, and increasingly, \nphysicians are learning how subtle changes in many different genes, \nacting in an integrative contextual way, can affect the function of cells \nand organisms. Clinicians have developed a new appreciation of the \nrole  of  stem  cells  in  normal  tissue  function,  in  the  development  of \ncancer and other disorders, and in the treatment of certain diseases. \nEntirely new areas of research, including studies of the human micro-\nbiome,  epigenetics,  and  noncoding  RNAs  as  regulatory  features  of \nthe  genome,  have  become  important  for  understanding  both  health \nand  disease.  Information  technology  enables  the  interrogation  of \nmedical  records  from  millions  of  individuals,  yielding  new  insights \ninto the etiology, characteristics, prognosis, and stratification of many \ndiseases. With the increasing availability of very large data sets (\u201cbig \ndata\u201d) from omic analyses and the electronic medical record, there is \nnow  a  growing  need  for  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence \nfor  unbiased  analyses  that  enhance  clinical  predictive  accuracy.  The \nknowledge gleaned from the science of medicine continues to enhance \nthe  understanding  by  physicians  of  complex  pathologic  processes \nand to provide new approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment.  With  continued  refinement  of  unique  omic  signatures \ncoupled with nuanced clinical pathophenotypes, the profession moves \never  closer  to  practical  precision  medicine.  Yet,  skill  in  the  most \nsophisticated applications of laboratory technology and in the use of \nthe latest therapeutic modality alone does not make a good physician. \nExtraordinary  advances  in  vaccine  platform  technology  and  the  use \nof cryo-electron microscopy for the structure-based design of vaccine \nimmunogens  have  transformed  the  field  of  vaccinology,  resulting  in \nthe unprecedented speed and success with which COVID-19 vaccines \nwere developed.\n\nWhen  a  patient  poses  challenging  clinical  problems,  an  effective \nphysician  must  be  able  to  identify  the  crucial  elements  in  a  complex \nhistory  and  physical  examination;  order  the  appropriate  laboratory, \nimaging, and diagnostic tests; and extract the key results from densely \npopulated  computer  screens  to  determine  whether  to  treat  or  to \n\u201cwatch.\u201d As the number of tests increases, so does the likelihood that \nsome incidental finding, completely unrelated to the clinical problem \nat hand, will be uncovered. Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth \npursuing  or  should  be  dismissed  as  a  \u201cred  herring\u201d  and  weighing \nwhether  a  proposed  test,  preventive  measure,  or  treatment  entails  a \ngreater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled \nclinician must make many times each day. This combination of med-\nical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of \nmedicine, which is as necessary to the practice of medicine and the pre-\ncision medicine of the future as is a sound scientific base, and as impor-\ntant for contemporary medical practice as it has been in earlier eras.\n\n \u25a0 CLINICAL SKILLS\nHistory-Taking  The recorded history of an illness should include \nall  the  facts  of  medical  significance  in  the  life  of  the  patient.  Recent \nevents  should  be  given  the  most  attention.  Patients  should,  at  some \nearly point, have the opportunity to tell their own story of the illness \nwithout  frequent  interruption  and,  when  appropriate,  should  receive \nexpressions  of  interest,  encouragement,  and  empathy  from  the  phy-\nsician.  Any  event  related  by  a  patient,  however  trivial  or  seemingly \nirrelevant,  may  provide  the  key  to  solving  the  medical  problem.  A \nmethodical  review  of  systems  is  important  to  elicit  features  of  an \nunderlying disease that might not be mentioned in the patient\u2019s nar-\nrative.  In  general,  patients  who  feel  comfortable  with  the  physician \nwill offer more complete information; thus, putting the patient at ease \ncontributes substantially to obtaining an adequate history.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   1\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n"

By  listening  to  patients  and  noting  the  ways  in  which \nthey  describe  their  symptoms,  physicians  can  gain  valuable  insight. \nInflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude (i.e., \u201cbody \nlanguage\u201d)  may  offer  important  clues  to  patients\u2019  perception  of  and \nreaction  to  their  symptoms.  Because  patients  vary  considerably  in \ntheir  medical  sophistication  and  ability  to  recall  facts,  the  reported \nmedical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The social \nhistory also can provide important insights into the types of diseases \nthat should be considered and can identify practical considerations for \nsubsequent  management.  The  family  history  not  only  identifies  rare \ngenetic disorders or common exposures, but often reveals risk factors \nfor common disorders, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, \nautoimmunity,  and  asthma.  A  thorough  family  history  may  require \ninput  from  multiple  relatives  to  ensure  completeness  and  accuracy. \nAn experienced clinician can usually formulate a relevant differential \ndiagnosis from the history alone, using the physical examination and \ndiagnostic  tests  to  narrow  the  list  or  reveal  unexpected  findings  that \nlead to more focused inquiry.\n\nThe very act of eliciting the history provides the physician with an \nopportunity to establish or enhance a unique bond that can form the \nbasis for a good patient\u2013physician relationship. This process helps the \nphysician develop an appreciation of the patient\u2019s view of the illness, \nthe patient\u2019s expectations of the physician and the health care system, \nand the financial and social implications of the illness for the patient. \nAlthough  current  health  care  settings  may  impose  time  constraints \non patient visits, it is important not to rush the encounter. A hurried \napproach may lead patients to believe that what they are relating is not \nof  importance  to  the  physician,  and,  as  a  result,  they  may  withhold \nrelevant information. The confidentiality of the patient\u2013physician rela-\ntionship cannot be overemphasized.\n\nPhysical Examination  The purpose of the physical examination is \nto identify physical signs of disease. The significance of these objective \nindications of disease is enhanced when they confirm a functional or \nstructural change already suggested by the patient\u2019s history. At times, \nhowever, physical signs may be the only evidence of disease and may \nnot have been suggested by the history.\n\nThe physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with \nconsideration  given  to  the  patient\u2019s  comfort  and  modesty.  Although \nattention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part \nof the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head \nto toe in an objective search for abnormalities. The results of the exami-\nnation, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time \nthey are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distor-\ntions of memory. Physical examination skills should be learned under \ndirect observation of experienced clinicians. Even highly experienced \nclinicians can benefit from ongoing coaching and feedback. Simulation \nlaboratories and standardized patients play an increasingly important \nrole in the development of clinical skills. Although the skills of physical \ndiagnosis are acquired with experience, it is not merely technique that \ndetermines success in identifying signs of disease. The detection of a \nfew scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the \nabdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive \nfingers, but of a mind alert to those findings. Because physical findings \ncan change with time, the physical examination should be repeated as \nfrequently as the clinical situation warrants.\n\nGiven  the  many  highly  sensitive  diagnostic  tests  now  available \n(particularly  imaging  techniques),  it  may  be  tempting  to  place  less \nemphasis  on  the  physical  examination.  Some  are  critical  of  physical \ndiagnosis  based  on  perceived  low  levels  of  specificity  and  sensitivity. \nIndeed,  many  patients  are  seen  by  consultants  only  after  a  series  of \ndiagnostic tests have been performed and the results are known. This \nfact should not deter the physician from performing a thorough phys-\nical  examination  since  important  clinical  findings  may  have  escaped \ndetection  by  diagnostic  tests.  Especially  important,  a  thorough  and \nthoughtful  physical  examination  may  render  a  laboratory  finding \nunimportant (i.e., certain echocardiographic regurgitant lesions). The \nact of a hands-on examination of the patient also offers an opportunity \n\nfor  communication  and  may  have  reassuring  effects  that  foster  the \npatient\u2013physician relationship.\n\nDiagnostic  Studies  Physicians  rely  increasingly  on  a  wide  array \nof  laboratory  and  imaging  tests  to  make  diagnoses  and  ultimately  to \nsolve clinical problems; however, such information does not relieve the \nphysician from the responsibility of carefully observing and examining \nthe patient. It is also essential to appreciate the limitations of diagnos-\ntic  tests.  By  virtue  of  their  apparent  precision,  these  tests  often  gain \nan aura of certainty regardless of the fallibility of the tests themselves, \nthe  instruments  used  in  the  tests,  and  the  individuals  performing  or \ninterpreting the tests. Physicians must weigh the expense involved in \nlaboratory procedures against the value of the information these pro-\ncedures are likely to provide.\n\nSingle  laboratory  tests  are  rarely  ordered.  Instead,  physicians  gen-\nerally  request  \u201cbatteries\u201d  of  multiple  tests,  which  often  prove  useful \nand  can  be  performed  with  a  single  specimen  at  relatively  low  cost. \nFor example, abnormalities of hepatic function may provide the clue \nto nonspecific symptoms such as generalized weakness and increased \nfatigability, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic liver disease. Sometimes \na single abnormality, such as an elevated serum calcium level, points to \na particular disease, such as hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe  thoughtful  use  of  screening  tests  (e.g.,  measurement  of  low- \ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol) may allow early intervention to prevent \ndisease  (Chap.  6).  Screening  tests  are  most  informative  when  they \nare directed toward common diseases and when their results indicate \nwhether  other  potentially  useful\u2014but  often  costly\u2014tests  or  inter-\nventions  are  needed.  On  the  one  hand,  biochemical  measurements, \ntogether with simple laboratory determinations such as routine serum \nchemistries, blood counts, and urinalysis, often provide a major clue to \nthe presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician \nmust learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do \nnot necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after \nthe  report  of  an  isolated  laboratory  abnormality  in  a  person  who  is \notherwise  well  is  often  wasteful  and  unproductive.  Because  so  many \ntests are performed routinely for screening purposes, it is not unusual \nfor  one  or  two  values  to  be  slightly  abnormal.  Nevertheless,  even  if \nthere is no reason to suspect an underlying illness, tests yielding abnor-\nmal  results  ordinarily  are  repeated  to  rule  out  laboratory  error.  If  an \nabnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential sig-\nnificance in the context of the patient\u2019s condition and other test results.\nThere  is  almost  continual  development  of  technically  improved \nimaging  studies  with  greater  sensitivity  and  specificity.  These  tests \nprovide remarkably detailed anatomic information that can be pivotal \nin  informing  medical  decision-making.  MRI,  CT,  ultrasonography,  a \nvariety  of  isotopic  scans,  and  positron  emission  tomography  (PET) \nhave  supplanted  older,  more  invasive  approaches  and  opened  new \ndiagnostic  vistas.  In  light  of  their  capabilities  and  the  rapidity  with \nwhich they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of \nimaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which imaging \nstudies  revealed  findings  that  led  to  an  unexpected  diagnosis.  None-\ntheless,  patients  must  endure  each  of  these  tests,  and  the  added  cost \nof unnecessary testing is substantial. Furthermore, investigation of an \nunexpected abnormal finding may lead to an iatrogenic complication \nor  to  the  diagnosis  of  an  irrelevant  or  incidental  problem.  A  skilled \nphysician must learn to use these powerful diagnostic tools judiciously, \nalways  considering  whether  the  results  will  alter  management  and \nbenefit the patient.\n \u25a0 MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT CARE\nTeam-Based  Care  Medical  practice  has  long  involved  teams, \nparticularly  physicians  working  with  nurses  and,  more  recently,  with \nphysician  assistants  and  nurse  practitioners.  Advances  in  medicine \nhave increased our ability to manage very complex clinical situations \n(e.g.,  intensive  care  units  [ICUs],  bone  marrow  transplantation)  and \nhave shifted the burden of disease toward chronic illnesses. Because an \nindividual patient may have multiple chronic diseases, he or she may \nbe cared for by several specialists as well as a primary care physician. In \nthe inpatient setting, care may involve multiple consultants along with \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   2\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"
