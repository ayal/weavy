In the care of the suffering, [the \nphysician]  needs  technical  skill,  scientific  knowledge,  and  human  under-\nstanding. Tact, sympathy, and understanding are expected of the physician, \nfor the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered func-\ntions, damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. [The patient] is human, \nfearful, and hopeful, seeking relief, help, and reassurance.\n\n\u2014Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950\n\nThe practice of medicine has changed in significant ways since the first \nedition  of  this  book  was  published  in  1950.  The  advent  of  molecular \ngenetics, sophisticated new imaging techniques, robotics, and advances in \nbioinformatics and information technology have contributed to an explo-\nsion  of  scientific  information  that  has  changed  fundamentally  the  way \nphysicians  define,  diagnose,  treat,  and  attempt  to  prevent  disease.  This \ngrowth of scientific knowledge continues to evolve at an accelerated pace.\nThe widespread use of electronic medical records and the Internet \nhave altered the way physicians and other health care providers access \nand exchange information as a routine part of medical education and \npractice  (Fig.  1-1).  As  today\u2019s  physicians  strive  to  integrate  an  ever-\nexpanding  body  of  scientific  knowledge  into  everyday  practice,  it  is \ncritically important to remember two key principles: first, the ultimate \ngoal of medicine is to prevent disease and, when it occurs, to diagnose \nit early and provide effective treatment; and second, despite 70 years \nof scientific advances since the first edition of this text, a trusting rela-\ntionship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of effective \npatient care.\n\n \u25a0 THE SCIENCE AND ART OF MEDICINE\nDeductive reasoning and applied technology form the foundation for \nthe approach and solution to many clinical problems. Extraordinary \nadvances  in  biochemistry,  cell  biology,  immunology,  and  genomics, \n\nFIGURE 1-1  The Doctor by Luke Fildes depicts the caring relationship between \nthis Victorian physician and a very ill child. Painted in 1891, the painting reflects \nthe death of the painter\u2019s young son from typhoid fever and was intended to reflect \nthe compassionate care provided by the physician even when his tools were not \nable to influence the course of disease.

Revelations about the nature of genes and \nsingle  cells  have  opened  a  portal  for  formulating  a  new  molecular \nbasis  for  the  physiology  of  systems.  Researchers  are  deciphering  the \ncomplex mechanisms by which genes are regulated, and increasingly, \nphysicians are learning how subtle changes in many different genes, \nacting in an integrative contextual way, can affect the function of cells \nand organisms. Clinicians have developed a new appreciation of the \nrole  of  stem  cells  in  normal  tissue  function,  in  the  development  of \ncancer and other disorders, and in the treatment of certain diseases. \nEntirely new areas of research, including studies of the human micro-\nbiome,  epigenetics,  and  noncoding  RNAs  as  regulatory  features  of \nthe  genome,  have  become  important  for  understanding  both  health \nand  disease.  Information  technology  enables  the  interrogation  of \nmedical  records  from  millions  of  individuals,  yielding  new  insights \ninto the etiology, characteristics, prognosis, and stratification of many \ndiseases. With the increasing availability of very large data sets (\u201cbig \ndata\u201d) from omic analyses and the electronic medical record, there is \nnow  a  growing  need  for  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence \nfor  unbiased  analyses  that  enhance  clinical  predictive  accuracy.  The \nknowledge gleaned from the science of medicine continues to enhance \nthe  understanding  by  physicians  of  complex  pathologic  processes \nand to provide new approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment.  With  continued  refinement  of  unique  omic  signatures \ncoupled with nuanced clinical pathophenotypes, the profession moves \never  closer  to  practical  precision  medicine.  Yet,  skill  in  the  most \nsophisticated applications of laboratory technology and in the use of \nthe latest therapeutic modality alone does not make a good physician. \nExtraordinary  advances  in  vaccine  platform  technology  and  the  use \nof cryo-electron microscopy for the structure-based design of vaccine \nimmunogens  have  transformed  the  field  of  vaccinology,  resulting  in \nthe unprecedented speed and success with which COVID-19 vaccines \nwere developed.\n\nWhen  a  patient  poses  challenging  clinical  problems,  an  effective \nphysician  must  be  able  to  identify  the  crucial  elements  in  a  complex \nhistory  and  physical  examination;  order  the  appropriate  laboratory, \nimaging, and diagnostic tests; and extract the key results from densely \npopulated  computer  screens  to  determine  whether  to  treat  or  to \n\u201cwatch.\u201d As the number of tests increases, so does the likelihood that \nsome incidental finding, completely unrelated to the clinical problem \nat hand, will be uncovered. Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth \npursuing  or  should  be  dismissed  as  a  \u201cred  herring\u201d  and  weighing \nwhether  a  proposed  test,  preventive  measure,  or  treatment  entails  a \ngreater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled \nclinician must make many times each day. This combination of med-\nical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of \nmedicine, which is as necessary to the practice of medicine and the pre-\ncision medicine of the future as is a sound scientific base, and as impor-\ntant for contemporary medical practice as it has been in earlier eras.\n\n \u25a0 CLINICAL SKILLS\nHistory-Taking  The recorded history of an illness should include \nall  the  facts  of  medical  significance  in  the  life  of  the  patient.  Recent \nevents  should  be  given  the  most  attention.  Patients  should,  at  some \nearly point, have the opportunity to tell their own story of the illness \nwithout  frequent  interruption  and,  when  appropriate,  should  receive \nexpressions  of  interest,  encouragement,  and  empathy  from  the  phy-\nsician.  Any  event  related  by  a  patient,  however  trivial  or  seemingly \nirrelevant,  may  provide  the  key  to  solving  the  medical  problem.  A \nmethodical  review  of  systems  is  important  to  elicit  features  of  an \nunderlying disease that might not be mentioned in the patient\u2019s nar-\nrative.  In  general,  patients  who  feel  comfortable  with  the  physician \nwill offer more complete information; thus, putting the patient at ease \ncontributes substantially to obtaining an adequate history.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   1\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n"

By  listening  to  patients  and  noting  the  ways  in  which \nthey  describe  their  symptoms,  physicians  can  gain  valuable  insight. \nInflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude (i.e., \u201cbody \nlanguage\u201d)  may  offer  important  clues  to  patients\u2019  perception  of  and \nreaction  to  their  symptoms.  Because  patients  vary  considerably  in \ntheir  medical  sophistication  and  ability  to  recall  facts,  the  reported \nmedical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The social \nhistory also can provide important insights into the types of diseases \nthat should be considered and can identify practical considerations for \nsubsequent  management.  The  family  history  not  only  identifies  rare \ngenetic disorders or common exposures, but often reveals risk factors \nfor common disorders, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, \nautoimmunity,  and  asthma.  A  thorough  family  history  may  require \ninput  from  multiple  relatives  to  ensure  completeness  and  accuracy. \nAn experienced clinician can usually formulate a relevant differential \ndiagnosis from the history alone, using the physical examination and \ndiagnostic  tests  to  narrow  the  list  or  reveal  unexpected  findings  that \nlead to more focused inquiry.\n\nThe very act of eliciting the history provides the physician with an \nopportunity to establish or enhance a unique bond that can form the \nbasis for a good patient\u2013physician relationship. This process helps the \nphysician develop an appreciation of the patient\u2019s view of the illness, \nthe patient\u2019s expectations of the physician and the health care system, \nand the financial and social implications of the illness for the patient. \nAlthough  current  health  care  settings  may  impose  time  constraints \non patient visits, it is important not to rush the encounter. A hurried \napproach may lead patients to believe that what they are relating is not \nof  importance  to  the  physician,  and,  as  a  result,  they  may  withhold \nrelevant information. The confidentiality of the patient\u2013physician rela-\ntionship cannot be overemphasized.\n\nPhysical Examination  The purpose of the physical examination is \nto identify physical signs of disease. The significance of these objective \nindications of disease is enhanced when they confirm a functional or \nstructural change already suggested by the patient\u2019s history. At times, \nhowever, physical signs may be the only evidence of disease and may \nnot have been suggested by the history.\n\nThe physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with \nconsideration  given  to  the  patient\u2019s  comfort  and  modesty.  Although \nattention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part \nof the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head \nto toe in an objective search for abnormalities. The results of the exami-\nnation, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time \nthey are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distor-\ntions of memory. Physical examination skills should be learned under \ndirect observation of experienced clinicians. Even highly experienced \nclinicians can benefit from ongoing coaching and feedback. Simulation \nlaboratories and standardized patients play an increasingly important \nrole in the development of clinical skills. Although the skills of physical \ndiagnosis are acquired with experience, it is not merely technique that \ndetermines success in identifying signs of disease. The detection of a \nfew scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the \nabdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive \nfingers, but of a mind alert to those findings. Because physical findings \ncan change with time, the physical examination should be repeated as \nfrequently as the clinical situation warrants.\n\nGiven  the  many  highly  sensitive  diagnostic  tests  now  available \n(particularly  imaging  techniques),  it  may  be  tempting  to  place  less \nemphasis  on  the  physical  examination.  Some  are  critical  of  physical \ndiagnosis  based  on  perceived  low  levels  of  specificity  and  sensitivity. \nIndeed,  many  patients  are  seen  by  consultants  only  after  a  series  of \ndiagnostic tests have been performed and the results are known. This \nfact should not deter the physician from performing a thorough phys-\nical  examination  since  important  clinical  findings  may  have  escaped \ndetection  by  diagnostic  tests.  Especially  important,  a  thorough  and \nthoughtful  physical  examination  may  render  a  laboratory  finding \nunimportant (i.e., certain echocardiographic regurgitant lesions). The \nact of a hands-on examination of the patient also offers an opportunity \n\nfor  communication  and  may  have  reassuring  effects  that  foster  the \npatient\u2013physician relationship.\n\nDiagnostic  Studies  Physicians  rely  increasingly  on  a  wide  array \nof  laboratory  and  imaging  tests  to  make  diagnoses  and  ultimately  to \nsolve clinical problems; however, such information does not relieve the \nphysician from the responsibility of carefully observing and examining \nthe patient. It is also essential to appreciate the limitations of diagnos-\ntic  tests.  By  virtue  of  their  apparent  precision,  these  tests  often  gain \nan aura of certainty regardless of the fallibility of the tests themselves, \nthe  instruments  used  in  the  tests,  and  the  individuals  performing  or \ninterpreting the tests. Physicians must weigh the expense involved in \nlaboratory procedures against the value of the information these pro-\ncedures are likely to provide.\n\nSingle  laboratory  tests  are  rarely  ordered.  Instead,  physicians  gen-\nerally  request  \u201cbatteries\u201d  of  multiple  tests,  which  often  prove  useful \nand  can  be  performed  with  a  single  specimen  at  relatively  low  cost. \nFor example, abnormalities of hepatic function may provide the clue \nto nonspecific symptoms such as generalized weakness and increased \nfatigability, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic liver disease. Sometimes \na single abnormality, such as an elevated serum calcium level, points to \na particular disease, such as hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe  thoughtful  use  of  screening  tests  (e.g.,  measurement  of  low- \ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol) may allow early intervention to prevent \ndisease  (Chap.  6).  Screening  tests  are  most  informative  when  they \nare directed toward common diseases and when their results indicate \nwhether  other  potentially  useful\u2014but  often  costly\u2014tests  or  inter-\nventions  are  needed.  On  the  one  hand,  biochemical  measurements, \ntogether with simple laboratory determinations such as routine serum \nchemistries, blood counts, and urinalysis, often provide a major clue to \nthe presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician \nmust learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do \nnot necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after \nthe  report  of  an  isolated  laboratory  abnormality  in  a  person  who  is \notherwise  well  is  often  wasteful  and  unproductive.  Because  so  many \ntests are performed routinely for screening purposes, it is not unusual \nfor  one  or  two  values  to  be  slightly  abnormal.  Nevertheless,  even  if \nthere is no reason to suspect an underlying illness, tests yielding abnor-\nmal  results  ordinarily  are  repeated  to  rule  out  laboratory  error.  If  an \nabnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential sig-\nnificance in the context of the patient\u2019s condition and other test results.\nThere  is  almost  continual  development  of  technically  improved \nimaging  studies  with  greater  sensitivity  and  specificity.  These  tests \nprovide remarkably detailed anatomic information that can be pivotal \nin  informing  medical  decision-making.  MRI,  CT,  ultrasonography,  a \nvariety  of  isotopic  scans,  and  positron  emission  tomography  (PET) \nhave  supplanted  older,  more  invasive  approaches  and  opened  new \ndiagnostic  vistas.  In  light  of  their  capabilities  and  the  rapidity  with \nwhich they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of \nimaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which imaging \nstudies  revealed  findings  that  led  to  an  unexpected  diagnosis.  None-\ntheless,  patients  must  endure  each  of  these  tests,  and  the  added  cost \nof unnecessary testing is substantial. Furthermore, investigation of an \nunexpected abnormal finding may lead to an iatrogenic complication \nor  to  the  diagnosis  of  an  irrelevant  or  incidental  problem.  A  skilled \nphysician must learn to use these powerful diagnostic tools judiciously, \nalways  considering  whether  the  results  will  alter  management  and \nbenefit the patient.\n \u25a0 MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT CARE\nTeam-Based  Care  Medical  practice  has  long  involved  teams, \nparticularly  physicians  working  with  nurses  and,  more  recently,  with \nphysician  assistants  and  nurse  practitioners.  Advances  in  medicine \nhave increased our ability to manage very complex clinical situations \n(e.g.,  intensive  care  units  [ICUs],  bone  marrow  transplantation)  and \nhave shifted the burden of disease toward chronic illnesses. Because an \nindividual patient may have multiple chronic diseases, he or she may \nbe cared for by several specialists as well as a primary care physician. In \nthe inpatient setting, care may involve multiple consultants along with \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   2\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

    "text": "the primary admitting physician. Communication through the medical \nrecord is necessary but not sufficient, particularly when patients have \ncomplex medical problems or when difficult decisions need to be made \nabout the optimal management plan. Physicians should optimally meet \nface-to-face or by phone to ensure clear communication and thought-\nful  planning.  It  is  important  to  note  that  patients  often  receive  or \nperceive different messages from various care providers; thus, attempts \nshould be made to provide consistency among these messages to the \npatient. Management plans and treatment options should be outlined \nsuccinctly and clearly for the patient.\n\nAnother dimension of team-based care involves allied health profes-\nsions. It is not unusual for a hospitalized patient to encounter physical \ntherapists,  pharmacists,  respiratory  therapists,  radiology  technicians, \nsocial workers, dieticians, and transport personnel (among others) in \naddition to physicians and nurses. Each of these individuals contrib-\nutes to clinical care as well as to the patient\u2019s experience with the health \ncare  system.  In  the  outpatient  setting,  disease  screening  and  chronic \ndisease management are often carried out by nurses, physician assis-\ntants, or other allied health professionals.\n\nThe  growth  of  team-based  care  has  important  implications  for \nmedical  culture,  student  and  resident  training,  and  the  organization \nof health care systems. Despite diversity in training, skills, and respon-\nsibilities among health care professionals, common values need to be \nespoused  and  reinforced.  Many  medical  schools  have  incorporated \ninterprofessional teamwork into their curricula. Effective communica-\ntion is inevitably the most challenging aspect of implementing team-\nbased care. While communication can be aided by electronic devices, \nincluding medical records, apps, or text messages, it is vitally important \nto balance efficiency with taking the necessary time to speak directly \nwith colleagues.\n\nThe  Dichotomy  of  Inpatient  and  Outpatient  Internal  \nMedicine  The  hospital  environment  has  undergone  sweeping \nchanges over the past few decades. Emergency departments and critical \ncare units have evolved to manage critically ill patients, allowing them \nto survive formerly fatal conditions. In parallel, there is increasing pres-\nsure to reduce the length of stay in the hospital and to manage complex \ndisorders  in  the  outpatient  setting.  This  transition  has  been  driven \nnot only by efforts to reduce costs but also by the availability of new \noutpatient  technologies,  such  as  imaging  and  percutaneous  infusion \ncatheters  for  long-term  antibiotics  or  nutrition,  minimally  invasive \nsurgical  procedures,  and  evidence  that  outcomes  often  are  improved \nby reducing inpatient hospitalization.\n\nIn  addition  to  traditional  medical  beds,  hospitals  now  encompass \nmultiple  distinct  levels  of  care,  such  as  the  emergency  department, \nprocedure rooms, overnight observation units, critical care units, and \npalliative  care  units.  A  consequence  of  this  differentiation  has  been \nthe emergence of new specialties (e.g., emergency medicine and end-\nof-life  care)  and  the  provision  of  in-hospital  care  by  hospitalists  and \nintensivists.  Most  hospitalists  are  board-certified  internists  who  bear \nprimary responsibility for the care of hospitalized patients and whose \nwork is limited entirely to the hospital setting. The shortened length \nof hospital stay means that most patients receive only acute care while \nhospitalized;  the  increased  complexities  of  inpatient  medicine  make \nthe  presence  of  an  internist  with  specific  training,  skills,  and  expe-\nrience  in  the  hospital  environment  extremely  beneficial.  Intensivists \nare  board-certified  physicians  who  are  further  certified  in  critical \ncare medicine and who direct and provide care for very ill patients in \ncritical care units. Clearly, an important challenge in internal medicine \ntoday is to ensure the continuity of communication and information \nflow  between  a  patient\u2019s  primary  care  physician  and  those  who  are \nin charge of the patient\u2019s hospital care. Maintaining these channels of \ncommunication is frequently complicated by patient \u201chandoffs\u201d\u2014i.e., \ntransitions  from  the  outpatient  to  the  inpatient  environment,  from \nthe critical care unit to a general medicine floor, from a medical to a \nsurgical service and vice versa, from the hospital environment to the \nrecently  developed  \u201chome  hospital\u201d  setting  (for  select  patients  with \nadequate home support), and from the hospital or home hospital to the \noutpatient environment.\n\nThe  involvement  of  many  care  providers  in  conjunction  with \nthese  transitions  can  threaten  the  traditional  one-to-one  relationship \nbetween  patient  and  primary  care  physician.  Of  course,  patients  can \nbenefit greatly from effective collaboration among a number of health \ncare professionals; however, it is the duty of the patient\u2019s principal or pri-\nmary physician to provide cohesive guidance through an illness. To meet \nthis challenge, primary care physicians must be familiar with the tech-\nniques, skills, and objectives of specialist physicians and allied health \nprofessionals  who  care  for  their  patients  in  the  hospital.  In  addition, \nprimary  care  physicians  must  ensure  that  their  patients  benefit  from \nscientific advances and the expertise of specialists, both in and out of \nthe hospital. Primary care physicians should explain the role of these \nspecialists to reassure patients that they are in the hands of physicians \nbest  trained  to  manage  their  current  illness.  However,  the  primary \ncare physician should assure patients and their families that decisions \nare  being  made  in  consultation  with  these  specialists.  The  evolving \nconcept of the \u201cmedical home\u201d incorporates team-based primary care \nwith subspecialty care in a cohesive environment that ensures smooth \ntransitions of care.\n\n3\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n1\n\nT\nh\ne\nP\nr\na\nc\nt\ni\nc\ne\no\nf\n\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\ni\nn\ne\n\nMitigating the Stress of Acute Illness  Few people are prepared \nfor a new diagnosis of cancer or anticipate the occurrence of a myocar-\ndial infarction, stroke, or major accident. The care of a frightened or \ndistraught patient is confounded by these understandable responses to \nlife-threatening events. The physician and other health providers can \nreduce the shock of life-changing events by providing information in a \nclear, calm, consistent, and reassuring manner. Often, information and \nreassurance need to be repeated. Caregivers should also recognize that, \nfor  the  typical  patient,  hospital  emergency  rooms,  operating  rooms, \nICUs,  and  general  medical  floors  represent  an  intimidating  environ-\nment.  Hospitalized  patients  find  themselves  surrounded  by  air  jets, \nbuttons, and glaring lights; invaded by tubes and wires; and beset by the \nnumerous members of the health care team\u2014hospitalists, specialists, \nnurses,  nurses\u2019  aides,  physician  assistants,  social  workers,  technolo-\ngists,  physical  therapists,  medical  students,  house  officers,  attending \nand consulting physicians, and many others. They may be transported \nto  special  laboratories  and  imaging  facilities  replete  with  blinking \nlights,  strange  sounds,  and  unfamiliar  personnel;  they  may  be  left \nunattended at times; and they may be obligated to share a room with \nother patients who have their own health problems. It is little wonder \nthat patients may find this environment bewildering and stressful. The \nadditive  effects  of  an  acute  illness,  unfamiliar  environment,  multiple \nmedications, and sleep deprivation can lead to confusion or delirium, \nespecially in older hospitalized patients. Physicians who appreciate the \nhospital  experience  from  the  patient\u2019s  perspective  and  who  make  an \neffort to guide the patient through this experience may make a stress-\nful  situation  more  tolerable  and  enhance  the  patient\u2019s  chances  for  an \noptimal recovery.\n\nMedical  Decision-Making  Medical  decision-making  is  a  fun-\ndamental  responsibility  of  the  physician  and  occurs  at  each  stage  of \nthe diagnostic and therapeutic process. The decision-making process \ninvolves  the  ordering  of  additional  tests,  requests  for  consultations, \ndecisions about treatment, and predictions concerning prognosis. This \nprocess  requires  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology \nand  natural  history  of  disease.  Formulating  a  differential  diagnosis \nrequires not only a broad knowledge base but also the ability to assess \nthe relative probabilities of various diseases for a given patient. Appli-\ncation of the scientific method, including hypothesis formulation and \ndata  collection,  is  essential  to  the  process  of  accepting  or  rejecting  a \nparticular diagnosis. Analysis of the differential diagnosis is an itera-\ntive process. As new information or test results are acquired, the group \nof disease processes being considered can be contracted or expanded \nappropriately. Whenever possible, decisions should be evidence-based, \ntaking advantage of rigorously designed clinical trials or objective com-\nparisons of different diagnostic tests. Evidence-based medicine stands in \nsharp contrast to anecdotal experience, which is often biased. Unless \nattuned to the importance of using larger, objective studies for making \ndecisions,  even  the  most  experienced  physicians  can  be  influenced \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   3\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

It is important to remember, however, that \nonly a small fraction of the many decisions made in clinical practice \nare  based  on  rigorous  clinical  trial  evidence;  other  guideline  recom-\nmendations are, therefore, predicated on expert consensus and weaker \nevidentiary support.\n\nThus, the importance of evidence-based medicine notwithstanding, \nmuch medical decision-making still relies on good clinical judgment, \nan attribute that is difficult to quantify or even to assess qualitatively. \nPhysicians  must  use  their  knowledge  and  experience  as  a  basis  for \nweighing  known  factors,  along  with  the  inevitable  uncertainties,  and \nthen making a sound judgment; this synthesis of information is partic-\nularly important when a relevant evidence base is not available. Several \nquantitative tools may be invaluable in synthesizing the available infor-\nmation, including diagnostic tests, Bayes\u2019 theorem (the probability of \nan event predicated on prior knowledge of conditions possibly related \nto the event), and multivariate statistical models (Chap. 4). Diagnos-\ntic  tests  serve  to  reduce  uncertainty  about  an  individual\u2019s  diagnosis \nor prognosis and help the physician decide how best to manage that \nindividual\u2019s condition. The battery of diagnostic tests complements the \nhistory and physical examination. The accuracy of a particular test is \nascertained by determining its sensitivity (true-positive rate) and spec-\nificity (true-negative rate), as well as the predictive value of a positive \nand a negative result. See Chap. 4 for a more thorough discussion of \ndecision-making in clinical medicine.\n\nPractice Guidelines  Many professional organizations and govern-\nment agencies have developed formal clinical-practice guidelines to aid \nphysicians and other caregivers in making diagnostic and therapeutic \ndecisions that are evidence-based, cost-effective, and most appropriate \nto  a  particular  patient  and  clinical  situation.  As  the  evidence  base  of \nmedicine  increases,  guidelines  can  provide  a  useful  framework  for \nmanaging  patients  with  particular  diagnoses  or  symptoms.  Clinical \nguidelines  can  protect  patients\u2014particularly  those  with  inadequate \nhealth  care  benefits\u2014from  receiving  substandard  care.  These  guide-\nlines  also  can  protect  conscientious  caregivers  from  inappropriate \ncharges of malpractice and society from the excessive costs associated \nwith  the  overuse  of  medical  resources.  There  are,  however,  caveats \nassociated with clinical-practice guidelines since they tend to oversim-\nplify the complexities of medicine. Furthermore, groups with different \nperspectives may develop divergent recommendations regarding issues \nas  basic  as  the  need  for  screening  of  women  by  mammography  or \nof  men  with  serum  prostate-specific  antigen  (PSA)  measurements. \nFinally,  guidelines,  as  the  term  implies,  do  not\u2014and  cannot  be \nexpected to\u2014account for the uniqueness of each individual and his or \nher illness. The physician\u2019s challenge is to integrate into clinical practice \nthe useful recommendations offered by experts without accepting them \nblindly or being inappropriately constrained by them.\n\nPrecision  Medicine  The  concept  of  precision  or  personalized \nmedicine  reflects  the  growing  recognition  that  diseases  once  lumped \ntogether  can  be  further  stratified  on  the  basis  of  genetic,  biomarker, \nphenotypic, and/or psychosocial characteristics that distinguish a given \npatient from other patients with similar clinical presentations. Inherent \nin this concept is the goal of targeting therapies in a more specific way \nto improve clinical outcomes for the individual patient and minimize \nunnecessary  side  effects  for  those  less  likely  to  respond  to  a  partic-\nular  treatment.  In  some  respects,  precision  medicine  represents  the \nevolution of clinical practice guidelines, which are usually developed \nfor  populations  of  patients  or  a  particular  diagnosis  (e.g.,  hyperten-\nsion, thyroid nodule). As the pathobiology, prognosis, and treatment \nresponses of subgroups within these diagnoses become better under-\nstood (i.e., through refined genomic analysis or enhanced deep pheno-\ntyping), the relevant clinical guidelines incorporate progressively more \nrefined  recommendations  for  individuals  within  these  subgroups. \nThe role of precision medicine is best illustrated for cancers in which \ngenetic  testing  is  able  to  predict  responses  (or  the  lack  thereof)  to \n\ntargeted therapies (Chap. 73). One can anticipate similar applications \nof precision medicine in pharmacogenomics, immunologic disorders, \nand diseases in which biomarkers can predict treatment responses. See \nChap. 5 for a more thorough discussion of precision medicine.\n\nEvaluation  of  Outcomes  Clinicians  generally  use  objective  and \nreadily measurable parameters to judge the outcome of a therapeutic \nintervention.  These  measures  may  oversimplify  the  complexity  of  a \nclinical condition as patients often present with a major clinical prob-\nlem in the context of multiple complicating background illnesses. For \nexample, a patient may present with chest pain and cardiac ischemia, \nbut with a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and \nrenal insufficiency. For this reason, outcome measures, such as mor-\ntality,  length  of  hospital  stay,  or  readmission  rates,  are  typically  risk- \nadjusted. An important point to remember is that patients usually seek \nmedical attention for subjective reasons; they wish to obtain relief from \npain, to preserve or regain function, and to enjoy life. The components \nof a patient\u2019s health status or quality of life can include bodily comfort, \ncapacity for physical activity, personal and professional function, sex-\nual function, cognitive function, and overall perception of health. Each \nof these important domains can be assessed through structured inter-\nviews or specially designed questionnaires. Such assessments provide \nuseful parameters by which a physician can judge patients\u2019 subjective \nviews  of  their  disabilities  and  responses  to  treatment,  particularly  in \nchronic  illness.  The  practice  of  medicine  requires  consideration  and \nintegration of both objective and subjective outcomes.\n\nMany health systems use survey and patient feedback data to assess \nqualitative features such as patient satisfaction, access to care, and com-\nmunication with nurses and physicians. In the United States, HCAHPS \n(Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) \nsurveys  are  used  by  many  systems  and  are  publicly  reported.  Social \nmedia is also being used to assess feedback in real time as well as to \nshare patient experiences with health care systems, potentially enrich-\ning the information available for use in medical decisions.\n\nErrors in the Delivery of Health Care  A series of reports from \nthe  Institute  of  Medicine  (now  the  National  Academy  of  Medicine \n[NAM]) called for an ambitious agenda to reduce medical error rates \nand improve patient safety by designing and implementing fundamen-\ntal changes in health care systems (Chap. 8). It is the responsibility of \nhospitals  and  health  care  organizations  to  develop  systems  to  reduce \nrisk  and  ensure  patient  safety.  Medication  errors  can  be  reduced \nthrough the use of ordering systems that rely on electronic processes \nor, when electronic options are not available, that eliminate misreading \nof  handwriting.  Whatever  the  clinical  situation,  it  is  the  physician\u2019s \nresponsibility  to  use  powerful  therapeutic  measures  wisely,  with  due \nregard for their beneficial actions, potential dangers, and cost. Imple-\nmentation of infection control systems, enforcement of hand-washing \nprotocols,  and  careful  oversight  of  antibiotic  use  can  minimize  the \ncomplications  of  nosocomial  infections.  Central-line  infection  rates \nand catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been dramatically \nreduced at many centers by careful adherence of trained personnel to \nstandardized  protocols  for  introducing  and  maintaining  central  lines \nand  urinary  catheters,  respectively.  Rates  of  surgical  infection  and \nwrong-site surgery can likewise be reduced by the use of standardized \nprotocols and checklists. Falls by patients can be minimized by judi-\ncious use of sedatives and appropriate assistance with bed-to-chair and \nbed-to-bathroom transitions. Taken together, these and other measures \nare saving thousands of lives each year.\n\nElectronic  Medical  Records  Both  the  growing  reliance  on \ncomputers  and  the  strength  of  information  technology  now  play \ncentral  roles  in  medicine,  including  efforts  to  reduce  medical  errors. \nLaboratory  data  are  accessed  almost  universally  through  computers. \nMany  medical  centers  now  have  electronic  medical  records  (EMRs), \ncomputerized  order  entry,  and  bar-coded  tracking  of  medications. \nSome of these systems are interactive, sending reminders or warning \nof potential medical errors.\n\nEMRs offer rapid access to information that is invaluable in enhanc-\ning  health  care  quality  and  patient  safety,  including  relevant  data, \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   4\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

These data can be used to monitor and reduce \nunnecessary  variations  in  care  and  to  provide  real-time  information \nabout processes of care and clinical outcomes. Ideally, patient records \nare easily transferred across the health care system; however, techno-\nlogical  limitations  and  concerns  about  privacy  and  cost  continue  to \nlimit broad-based use of EMRs in many clinical settings.\n\nFor all of the advantages of EMRs, they can create distance between \nthe physician and patient if care is not taken to preserve face-to-face \ncontact.  EMRs  also  require  training  and  time  for  data  entry.  Many \nproviders  spend  significant  time  entering  information  to  generate \nstructured data and to meet billing requirements. They may feel pres-\nsured to take short cuts, such as \u201ccutting and pasting\u201d parts of earlier \nnotes into the daily record, thereby increasing the risk of errors. EMRs \nalso  structure  information  in  a  manner  that  disrupts  the  traditional \nnarrative flow across time and among providers. These features, which \nmay  be  frustrating  for  some  providers,  must  be  weighed  against  the \nadvantages of ready access to past medical history, imaging, laboratory \ndata, and consultant notes. Furthermore, the effort, time, and attention \nneeded to maintain and utilize the EMR have led to a growing sense of \ndissatisfaction among physicians, lessening professional and personal \nwell-being  as  a  result.  Clearly,  this  is  an  area  of  daily  practice  that \nrequires  improvement  both  for  the  delivery  of  safe  and  optimal  care \nand physician wellness.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that information technology is merely \na tool and can never replace the clinical decisions that are best made by \nthe physician. Clinical knowledge and an understanding of a patient\u2019s \nneeds,  supplemented  by  quantitative  tools,  still  represent  the  best \napproach to decision-making in the practice of medicine.\n\nTHE PATIENT\u2013PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP\nThe  significance  of  the  intimate  personal  relationship  between  physician \nand patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily \nlarge number of cases both the diagnosis and treatment are directly depen-\ndent on it. One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in human-\nity, for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\n\n\u2014Francis W. Peabody, October 21, 1925,  \nLecture at Harvard Medical School\n\nPhysicians must never forget that patients are individuals with prob-\nlems  that  all  too  often  transcend  their  physical  complaints.  They  are \nnot  \u201ccases\u201d  or  \u201cadmissions\u201d  or  \u201cdiseases.\u201d  Patients  do  not  fail  treat-\nments;  treatments  fail  to  benefit  patients.  This  point  is  particularly \nimportant  in  this  era  of  high  technology  in  clinical  medicine.  Most \npatients  are  anxious  and  fearful.  Physicians  should  instill  confidence \nand  offer  reassurance,  but  they  must  never  come  across  as  arrogant, \npatronizing,  impatient,  or  hurried.  A  professional  attitude,  coupled \nwith  warmth  and  openness,  can  do  much  to  alleviate  anxiety  and  to \nencourage patients to share all aspects of their medical history. Empa-\nthy and compassion are the essential features of a caring physician. The \nphysician needs to consider the setting in which an illness occurs\u2014in \nterms not only of patients themselves but also of their familial, social, \nand  cultural  backgrounds.  The  ideal  patient\u2013physician  relationship \nis based on thorough knowledge of the patient, mutual trust, and the \nability to communicate.\n\nInformed Consent  The fundamental principles of medical ethics \nrequire  physicians  to  act  in  the  patient\u2019s  best  interest  and  to  respect \nthe patient\u2019s autonomy. Both principles are reflected in the process of \ninformed consent. Patients are required to sign consent forms for most \ndiagnostic  or  therapeutic  procedures.  Many  patients  possess  limited \nmedical knowledge and must rely on their physicians for advice. Com-\nmunicating  in  a  clear  and  understandable  manner,  physicians  must \nfully discuss the alternatives for care and explain the risks, benefits, and \nlikely  consequences  of  each  alternative.  The  physician  is  responsible \nfor  ensuring  that  the  patient  thoroughly  understands  these  risks  and \nbenefits; encouraging questions is an important part of this process. It \nmay be necessary to go over certain issues with the patient more than \nonce. This is the very definition of informed consent. Complete, clear \n\nexplanation and discussion of the proposed procedures and treatment \ncan greatly mitigate the fear of the unknown that commonly accom-\npanies hospitalization. Often the patient\u2019s understanding is enhanced \nby repeatedly discussing the issues in an unthreatening and supportive \nway, answering new questions that occur to the patient as they arise. \nContinuing  efforts  to  educate  the  patient  are  essential.  Patients  are \nfrequently  inhibited  from  understanding  by  the  fear  of  an  uncertain \nfuture and potential impact of the illness on themselves and their fam-\nilies. Clear communication can also help alleviate misunderstandings \nin  situations  where  complications  of  intervention  occur.  Special  care \nshould  also  be  taken  to  ensure  that  a  physician  seeking  a  patient\u2019s \ninformed consent has no real or apparent conflict of interest.\n\nApproach to Grave Prognoses and Death  No circumstance is \nmore distressing than the diagnosis of an incurable disease, particularly \nwhen premature death is inevitable. What should the patient and fam-\nily be told? What measures should be taken to maintain life? What can \nbe done to optimize quality of life?\n\nTransparency  of  information,  delivered  in  an  appropriate  manner, \nis  essential  in  the  face  of  a  terminal  illness.  Even  patients  who  seem \nunaware  of  their  medical  circumstances,  or  whose  family  members \nhave  protected  them  from  diagnoses  or  prognoses,  often  have  keen \ninsights into their condition. They may also have misunderstandings \nthat  can  lead  to  additional  anxiety.  The  patient  must  be  given  an \nopportunity to speak with the physician and ask questions. A wise and \ninsightful  physician  uses  such  open  communication  as  the  basis  for \nassessing  what  the  patient  wants  to  know  and  when  he  or  she  wants \nto know it. On the basis of the patient\u2019s responses, the physician can \nassess  the  most  appropriate  time  and  pace  for  sharing  information. \nUltimately,  the  patient  must  understand  the  expected  course  of  the \ndisease so that appropriate plans and preparations can be made. The \npatient should participate in decision-making with an understanding \nof the goal of treatment (palliation) and its likely effects. The patient\u2019s \nreligious beliefs should be taken into consideration. Some patients may \nfind it easier to share their feelings about death with their physician, \nnurses, or members of the clergy than with family members or friends.\nThe  physician  should  provide  or  arrange  for  emotional,  physical, \nand  spiritual  support,  and  must  be  compassionate,  unhurried,  and \nopen. In many instances, there is much to be gained by the laying on \nof hands. Pain should be controlled adequately, human dignity main-\ntained,  and  isolation  from  family  and  close  friends  avoided.  These \naspects of care tend to be overlooked in hospitals, where the intrusion \nof life-sustaining equipment can detract from attention to the individ-\nual person and encourage concentration instead on the life-threatening \ndisease, against which the battle ultimately will be lost in any case. In \nthe face of terminal illness, the goal of medicine must shift from cure to \ncare in the broadest sense of the term. Primum succurrere, first to help, \nis a guiding principle. In offering care to a dying patient, a physician \nshould be prepared to provide information to family members and deal \nwith  their  grief  and  sometimes  their  feelings  of  guilt  or  even  anger. \nIt  is  important  for  the  physician  to  assure  the  family  that  everything \nreasonable is being done. A substantial challenge in these discussions \nis  that  the  physician  often  does  not  know  exactly  how  to  gauge  the \nprognosis. In addition, various members of the health care team may \noffer  different  opinions.  Good  communication  among  providers  is \nessential so that consistent information is provided to patients. This is \nespecially important when the best path forward is uncertain. Advice \nfrom experts in palliative and terminal care should be sought whenever \nappropriate  to  ensure  that  clinicians  are  not  providing  patients  with \nunrealistic expectations. For a more complete discussion of end-of-\nlife care, see Chap. 12.\n\nMaintaining  Humanism  and  Professionalism  Many  trends \nin the delivery of health care tend to make medical care impersonal. \nThese trends, some of which have been mentioned already, include (1) \nvigorous  efforts  to  reduce  the  escalating  costs  of  health  care;  (2)  the \ngrowing  number  of  managed-care  programs,  which  are  intended  to \nreduce costs but where the patient may have little choice in selecting \na  physician;  (3)  increasing  reliance  on  technological  advances  and \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   5\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

The American Board of Internal Medicine, working together with \nthe American College of Physicians\u2013American Society of Internal Med-\nicine and the European Federation of Internal Medicine, has published a \nCharter on Medical Professionalism that underscores three main princi-\nples in physicians\u2019 contract with society: (1) the primacy of patient wel-\nfare, (2) patient autonomy, and (3) social justice. While medical schools \nappropriately  place  substantial  emphasis  on  professionalism,  a  physi-\ncian\u2019s personal attributes, including integrity, respect, and compassion, \nalso are extremely important. In the United States, the Gold Humanism \nSociety recognizes individuals who are exemplars of humanistic patient \ncare and serve as role models for medical education and training.\n\nAvailability to the patient, expression of sincere concern, willingness \nto  take  the  time  to  explain  all  aspects  of  the  illness,  and  a  nonjudg-\nmental attitude when dealing with patients whose cultures, lifestyles, \nattitudes, and values differ from those of the physician are just a few \nof  the  characteristics  of  a  humane  physician.  Every  physician  will, \nat  times,  be  challenged  by  patients  who  evoke  strongly  negative  or  \npositive emotional responses. Physicians should be alert to their own \nreactions to such situations and should consciously monitor and con-\ntrol their behavior so that the patient\u2019s best interest remains the princi-\npal motivation for their actions at all times.\n\nAnother  important  aspect  of  patient  care  involves  an  appreciation \nof  the  patient\u2019s  \u201cquality  of  life,\u201d  a  subjective  assessment  of  what  each \npatient  values  most.  This  assessment  requires  detailed,  sometimes \nintimate knowledge of the patient, which usually can be obtained only \nthrough deliberate, unhurried, and often repeated conversations. Time \npressures will always threaten these interactions, but they should not \ndiminish  the  importance  of  understanding  and  seeking  to  fulfill  the \npriorities of the patient.\n\n \u25a0 EXPANDING FRONTIERS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE\nThe  Era  of  \u201cOmics\u201d \nIn  the  spring  of  2003,  announcement  of  \nthe complete sequencing of the human genome officially ushered in the \ngenomic era. However, even before that landmark accomplishment, the \npractice of medicine had been evolving as a result of insights into both \nthe human genome and the genomes of a wide variety of microbes. The \nclinical  implications  of  these  insights  are  illustrated  by  the  complete \ngenome sequencing of H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 and even faster \nsequencing of COVID-19 in early 2020, leading to the swift develop-\nment and dissemination of effective vaccines. Today, gene expression \nprofiles  are  being  used  to  guide  therapy  and  inform  prognosis  for  a \nnumber of diseases, and genotyping is providing a new means to assess \nthe risk of certain diseases as well as variations in response to a num-\nber of drugs. Despite these advances, the use of complex genomics in \nthe diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease is still in its early \nstages.  The  task  of  physicians  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  pheno-\ntypes generally are determined not by genes alone but by the complex \ninteractions among genes and gene products, and by the interplay of \ngenetic and environmental factors.\n\nRapid  progress  is  also  being  made  in  other  areas  of  molecular \nmedicine.  Epigenetics  is  the  study  of  alterations  in  chromatin  and \nhistone  proteins  and  methylation  of  DNA  sequences  that  influence \ngene expression (Chap. 483). Every cell of the body has identical DNA \nsequences;  the  diverse  phenotypes  a  person\u2019s  cells  manifest  are,  in \npart, the result of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic \nalterations are associated with a number of cancers and other diseases. \nProteomics,  the  study  of  the  entire  library  of  proteins  made  in  a  cell \nor organ and the complex relationship of these proteins to disease, is \nenhancing  the  repertoire  of  the  23,000  genes  in  the  human  genome \nthrough alternate splicing, posttranslational processing, and posttrans-\nlational modifications that often have unique functional consequences. \nThe  presence  or  absence  of  particular  proteins  in  the  circulation  or \nin  cells  is  being  explored  for  many  diagnostic  and  disease-screening \n\napplications.  Microbiomics  is  the  study  of  the  resident  microbes  in \nhumans and other mammals, which together compose the microbiome. \nThe human haploid genome has ~23,000 genes, whereas the microbes \nresiding on and in the human body encompass more than 3\u20134 million \ngenes; these resident microbes are likely to be of great significance with \nregard  to  health  status.  Ongoing  research  is  demonstrating  that  the \nmicrobes inhabiting human mucosal and skin surfaces play a critical \nrole  in  maturation  of  the  immune  system,  in  metabolic  balance,  in \nbrain function, and in disease susceptibility. A variety of environmental \nfactors,  including  the  use  and  overuse  of  antibiotics,  have  been  tied \nexperimentally  to  substantial  increases  in  disorders  such  as  obesity, \nmetabolic  syndrome,  atherosclerosis,  and  immune-mediated  diseases \nin  both  adults  and  children.  Metagenomics,  of  which  microbiomics \nis a part, is the genomic study of environmental species that have the \npotential to influence human biology directly or indirectly. An example \nis the study of exposures to microorganisms in farm environments that \nmay be responsible for the lower incidence of asthma among children \nraised on farms. Metabolomics is the study of the range of metabolites \nin cells or organs and the ways they are altered in disease states. The \naging  process  itself  may  leave  telltale  metabolic  footprints  that  allow \nthe prediction (and possibly the prevention) of organ dysfunction and \ndisease.  It  seems  likely  that  disease-associated  patterns  will  be  found \nin lipids, carbohydrates, membranes, mitochondria and mitochondrial \nfunction, and other vital components of cells and tissues. Exposomics is \nthe study of the exposome\u2014i.e., the environmental exposures such as \nsmoking, sunlight, diet, exercise, education, and violence that together \nhave an enormous impact on health. All of this new information rep-\nresents a challenge to the traditional reductionist approach to medical \nthinking. The variability of results in different patients, together with \nthe large number of variables that can be assessed, creates challenges \nin identifying preclinical disease and defining disease states unequiv-\nocally. Accordingly, the tools of systems biology and network medicine \nare  being  applied  to  the  enormous  body  of  information  (\u201cbig  data\u201d) \nnow  obtainable  for  every  patient  and  may  eventually  provide  new \napproaches to classifying disease. For a more complete discussion of \na complex systems and network science approach to human disease, \nsee Chap. 486.\n\nThe rapidity of these advances may seem overwhelming to practic-\ning physicians; however, physicians have an important role to play in \nensuring that these powerful technologies and sources of new informa-\ntion are applied judiciously to patient care. Since omics are evolving so \nrapidly, physicians and other health care professionals must engage in \ncontinuous learning so that they can apply this new knowledge to the \nbenefit of their patients\u2019 health and well-being. Genetic testing requires \nwise counsel based on an understanding of the value and limitations of \nthe tests as well as the implications of their results for specific individu-\nals. For a more complete discussion of genetic testing, see Chap. 467.\nThe Globalization of Medicine  Physicians should be cognizant \nof  diseases  and  health  care  services  beyond  local  boundaries.  Global \ntravel has critical implications for disease spread, and it is not uncom-\nmon for diseases endemic to certain regions to be seen in other regions \nafter  a  patient  has  traveled  to  and  returned  from  those  regions.  The \noutbreak of Zika virus infections in the Americas is a cogent example \nof this phenomenon. In addition, factors such as wars, the migration of \nrefugees, and increasing climate extremes are contributing to changing \ndisease  profiles  worldwide.  Patients  have  broader  access  to  unique \nexpertise or clinical trials at distant medical centers, even those in other \ncountries, and the cost of travel may be offset by the quality of care at \nthose distant locations. As much as any other factor influencing global \naspects of medicine, the Internet has transformed the transfer of med-\nical information throughout the world. This change has been accom-\npanied by the transfer of technological skills through telemedicine and \ninternational  consultation\u2014for  example,  interpretation  of  radiologic \nimages and pathologic specimens. For a complete discussion of global \nissues, see Chap. 472.\nMedicine on the Internet  On  the  whole,  the  Internet  has  had  a \npositive effect on the practice of medicine; through personal computers, \na  wide  range  of  information  is  available  to  physicians  and  patients \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   6\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

    "text": "almost instantaneously at any time and from anywhere in the world. \nThis  medium  holds  enormous  potential  for  the  delivery  of  current \ninformation,  practice  guidelines,  state-of-the-art  conferences,  journal \ncontent,  textbooks  (including  this  text),  and  direct  communications \nwith other physicians and specialists, expanding the depth and breadth \nof information available to the physician regarding the diagnosis and \ncare  of  patients.  Medical  journals  are  now  accessible  online,  provid-\ning  rapid  sources  of  new  information.  By  bringing  them  into  direct \nand timely contact with the latest developments in medical care, this \nmedium also serves to lessen the information gap that has hampered \nphysicians and health care providers in remote areas.\n\nPatients, too, are turning to the Internet in increasing numbers to \nacquire  information  about  their  illnesses  and  therapies  and  to  join \nInternet-based  support  groups.  Patients  often  arrive  at  a  clinic  visit \nwith  sophisticated  information  about  their  illnesses.  In  this  regard, \nphysicians are challenged in a positive way to keep abreast of the latest \nrelevant information while serving as an \u201ceditor\u201d as patients navigate \nthis seemingly endless source of information, the accuracy and validity \nof which are not uniform.\n\nA critically important caveat is that virtually anything can be pub-\nlished  on  the  Internet,  with  easy  circumvention  of  the  peer-review \nprocess  that  is  an  essential  feature  of  academic  publications.  Both \nphysicians and patients who search the Internet for medical informa-\ntion  must  be  aware  of  this  danger.  Notwithstanding  this  limitation, \nappropriate  use  of  the  Internet  is  revolutionizing  information  access \nfor physicians and patients, and in this regard represents a remarkable \nresource that was not available to practitioners a generation ago.\nPublic  Expectations  and  Accountability  The  general  public\u2019s \nlevel  of  knowledge  and  sophistication  regarding  health  issues  has \ngrown rapidly over the past few decades. As a result, expectations of \nthe health care system in general and of physicians in particular have \nrisen. Physicians are expected to master rapidly advancing fields (the \nscience of medicine) while considering their patients\u2019 unique needs (the \nart  of  medicine).  Thus,  physicians  are  held  accountable  not  only  for \nthe technical aspects of the care they provide but also for their patients\u2019 \nsatisfaction with the delivery and costs of care.\n\nIn  many  parts  of  the  world,  physicians  increasingly  are  expected \nto  account  for  the  way  in  which  they  practice  medicine  by  meeting \ncertain  standards  prescribed  by  federal  and  local  governments.  The \nhospitalization  of  patients  whose  health  care  costs  are  reimbursed \nby  the  government  and  other  third  parties  is  subjected  to  utilization \nreview. Thus, a physician must defend the cause for and duration of a \npatient\u2019s  hospitalization  if  it  falls  outside  certain  \u201caverage\u201d  standards. \nAuthorization for reimbursement increasingly is based on documenta-\ntion of the nature and complexity of an illness, as reflected by recorded \nelements  of  the  history  and  physical  examination.  A  growing  \u201cpay-\nfor-performance\u201d movement seeks to link reimbursement to quality of \ncare. The goal of this movement is to improve standards of health care \nand  contain  spiraling  health  care  costs.  In  many  parts  of  the  United \nStates, managed (capitated) care contracts with insurers have replaced \ntraditional fee-for-service care, placing the onus of managing the cost \nof all care directly on the providers and increasing the emphasis on pre-\nventive strategies. In addition, physicians are expected to give evidence \nof their current competence through mandatory continuing education, \npatient record audits, maintenance of certification, and relicensing.\n\nMedical Ethics and New Technologies  The rapid pace of tech-\nnological advances has profound implications for medical applications \nthat  go  far  beyond  the  traditional  goals  of  disease  prevention,  treat-\nment, and cure. Cloning, genetic engineering, gene therapy, human\u2013\ncomputer  interfaces,  nanotechnology,  and  use  of  targeted  therapies \nhave  the  potential  to  modify  inherited  predispositions  to  disease, \nselect  desired  characteristics  in  embryos,  augment  \u201cnormal\u201d  human \nperformance, replace failing tissues, and substantially prolong life span. \nGiven  their  unique  training,  physicians  have  a  responsibility  to  help \nshape the debate on the appropriate uses of and limits placed on these \nnew technologies and to consider carefully the ethical issues associated \nwith the implementation of such interventions. As medicine becomes \nmore complex, shared decision-making is increasingly important, not \n\nonly in areas such as genetic counseling and end-of-life care, but also \nin diagnostic and treatment options.\n\n7\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n1\n\nT\nh\ne\nP\nr\na\nc\nt\ni\nc\ne\no\nf\n\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\ni\nn\ne\n\nLearning  Medicine  More  than  a  century  has  passed  since  the \npublication  of  the  Flexner  Report,  a  seminal  study  that  transformed \nmedical education and emphasized the scientific foundations of medi-\ncine as well as the acquisition of clinical skills. In an era of burgeoning \ninformation and access to medical simulation and informatics, many \nschools are implementing new curricula that emphasize lifelong learn-\ning and the acquisition of competencies in teamwork, communication \nskills, system-based practice, and professionalism. The tools of medi-\ncine also change continuously, necessitating formal training in the use \nof EMRs, large datasets, ultrasound, robotics, and new imaging tech-\nniques. These and other features of the medical school curriculum pro-\nvide the foundation for many of the themes highlighted in this chapter \nand are expected to allow physicians to progress, with experience and \nlearning over time, from competency to proficiency to mastery.\n\nAt a time when the amount of information that must be mastered \nto  practice  medicine  continues  to  expand,  increasing  pressures  both \nwithin  and  outside  of  medicine  have  led  to  the  implementation  of \nrestrictions on the amount of time a physician-in-training can spend \nin the hospital and in clinics. Because the benefits associated with con-\ntinuity of medical care and observation of a patient\u2019s progress over time \nwere thought to be outstripped by the stresses imposed on trainees by \nlong hours and by fatigue-related errors, strict limits were set on the \nnumber of patients that trainees could be responsible for at one time, \nthe number of new patients they could evaluate in a day on call, and the \nnumber of hours they could spend in the hospital. In 1980, residents \nin medicine worked in the hospital more than 90 hours per week on \naverage. In 1989, their hours were restricted to no more than 80 per \nweek. Resident physicians\u2019 hours further decreased by ~10% between \n1996 and 2008, and in 2010, the Accreditation Council for Graduate \nMedical Education further restricted (i.e., to 16 hours per shift) consec-\nutive in-hospital duty hours for first-year residents. The impact of these \nchanges is still being assessed, but the evidence that medical errors have \ndecreased  as  a  consequence  is  sparse.  An  unavoidable  by-product  of \nfewer hours at the bedside is an increase in the number of \u201chandoffs\u201d \nof patient responsibility from one physician to another. These transfers \noften involve a transition from a physician who knows the patient well, \nhaving  evaluated  that  individual  on  admission,  to  a  physician  who \nknows  the  patient  less  well.  It  is  imperative  that  these  transitions  of \nresponsibility be handled with care and thoroughness, with all relevant \ninformation exchanged and acknowledged. These issues highlight the \nchallenge our profession has in establishing a reliable measure of phy-\nsician effectiveness.\n\nThe  Physician  as  Perpetual  Student  From  the  time  physi-\ncians graduate from medical school, it becomes all too apparent that \nthis  milestone  is  symbolic  and  that  they  must  embrace  the  role  of  a \n\u201cperpetual  student.\u201d  This  realization  is  at  the  same  time  exhilarating \nand anxiety-provoking. It is exhilarating because physicians can apply \nconstantly expanding knowledge to the treatment of their patients; it is \nanxiety-provoking because physicians realize that they will never know \nas much as they want or need to know. Ideally, physicians will trans-\nlate the latter feeling into energy through which they can continue to \nimprove and reach their potential. It is the physician\u2019s responsibility to \npursue new knowledge continually by reading, attending conferences \nand courses, and consulting colleagues and the Internet. This is often a \ndifficult task for a busy practitioner; however, a commitment to contin-\nued learning is an integral part of being a physician and must be given \nthe highest priority.\n\nThe  Physician  as  Citizen  Being  a  physician  is  a  privilege.  The \ncapacity  to  apply  one\u2019s  skills  for  the  benefit  of  fellow  human  beings \nis  a  noble  calling.  The  physician\u2013patient  relationship  is  inherently \nunbalanced  in  the  distribution  of  power.  In  light  of  their  influence, \nphysicians must always be aware of the potential impact of what they \ndo and say, and must always strive to strip away individual biases and \npreferences to find what is best for their patients. To the extent possible, \nphysicians should also act within their communities to promote health \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   7\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

Meeting these goals begins by setting a healthy \nexample  and  continues  in  taking  action  to  deliver  needed  care  even \nwhen personal financial compensation may not be available.\n\nResearch, Teaching, and the Practice of Medicine  The word \ndoctor  is  derived  from  the  Latin  docere,  \u201cto  teach.\u201d  As  teachers, \nphysicians  should  share  information  and  medical  knowledge  with \ncolleagues,  students  of  medicine  and  related  professions,  and  their \npatients.  The  practice  of  medicine  is  dependent  on  the  sum  total  of \nmedical knowledge, which in turn is based on an unending chain of \nscientific  discovery,  clinical  observation,  analysis,  and  interpretation. \nAdvances in medicine depend on the acquisition of new information \nthrough research, and improved medical care requires the transmission \nof that information. As part of their broader societal responsibilities, \nphysicians  should  encourage  patients  to  participate  in  ethical  and \nproperly approved clinical investigations if these studies do not impose \nundue  hazard,  discomfort,  or  inconvenience.  Physicians  engaged  in \nclinical research must be alert to potential conflicts of interest between \ntheir  research  goals  and  their  obligations  to  individual  patients.  The \nbest interests of the patient must always take priority.\n\nTo wrest from nature the secrets which have perplexed philosophers in all \nages,  to  track  to  their  sources  the  causes  of  disease,  to  correlate  the  vast \nstores of knowledge, that they may be quickly available for the prevention \nand cure of disease\u2014these are our ambitions.\n\n\u2014William Osler, 1849\u20131919\n\n \u25a0 FURTHER READING\nCheston CC et al: Social media use in medical education: A systematic \n\nreview.

McKibbin\n\n \u25a0 GOALS AND APPROACHES TO PREVENTION\nPrevention of acute and chronic diseases before their onset has been \nrecognized  as  one  of  the  hallmarks  of  excellent  medical  practice  for \ncenturies  and  is  now  used  as  a  metric  for  highly  functioning  health \ncare  systems.  The  ultimate  goal  of  preventive  strategies  is  to  avoid \npremature  death.  However,  as  longevity  has  increased  dramatically \n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nh\nt\nl\na\ne\nh\nf\no\n\nk\nc\no\nt\nS\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSquaring the curve\nwith compression\nof morbidity\n\nNormative aging\nwith gradual loss of\nstock of health\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAge\n\nFIGURE  2-1  Loss  of  health  with  aging.  Representation  of  normative  aging  with \nloss of the full stock of health with which individuals are born (indicating gain of \nmorbidity), contrasted with a squared curve with greater longevity and fuller stock \nof health (less morbidity) until shortly before death. The \u201csquared curve\u201d represents \nthe likely ideal situation for most patients.\n\nworldwide  over  the  last  century  (largely  as  a  result  of  public  health \npractices), increasing emphasis is placed on prevention for the purpose \nof preserving quality of life and extending the health span, not just the \nlife span. Given that all patients will eventually die, the goal of preven-\ntion ultimately becomes compression of morbidity toward the end of \nthe life span; that is, reduction of the amount of burden and time spent \nwith  disease  prior  to  dying.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2-1,  normative  aging \ntends to involve a steady decline in the stock of health, with acceler-\nating  decline  over  time.  Successful  prevention  offers  the  opportunity \nboth to extend life and to extend healthy life, thus \u201csquaring the curve\u201d \nof health loss during aging.\n\nPrevention strategies have been characterized as tertiary, secondary, \nprimary,  and  primordial.  Tertiary  prevention  requires  rapid  action  to \nprevent imminent death in the setting of acute illness, such as through \npercutaneous coronary intervention in the setting of ST-segment ele-\nvation myocardial infarction. Secondary prevention strategies focus on \navoiding the recurrence of disease and death in an individual who is \nalready affected. For example, tamoxifen is recommended for women \nwith  surgically  treated  early-stage,  estrogen  receptor\u2013positive  breast \ncancer, because it reduces the risk of recurrent breast cancer (including \nin the contralateral breast) and death. Primary prevention attempts to \nreduce the risk of incident disease among individuals with one or more \nrisk factors. Treatment of elevated blood pressure in individuals who \nhave not yet experienced cardiovascular disease represents one exam-\nple  of  primary  prevention  that  has  proven  effective  in  reducing  the \nincidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease.\n\nPrimordial prevention is a more recent concept (first introduced in \n1979)  that  focuses  on  prevention  of  the  development  of  risk  factors \nfor  disease,  not  just  prevention  of  disease.  Primordial  prevention \nstrategies  emphasize  upstream  determinants  of  risk  for  chronic  dis-\neases,  such  as  eating  patterns,  physical  activity,  and  environmental \nand  social  determinants  of  health.  It  therefore  encompasses  medical \ntreatment strategies for some individuals as well as a strong reliance on \npublic health and social policy. It is increasingly clear that primordial \nprevention  represents  the  ultimate  means  for  reducing  the  burden \nof  chronic  diseases  of  aging.  Once  risk  factors  develop,  it  is  difficult \nto  restore  risk  to  the  low  level  of  someone  who  never  developed  the \nrisk factor. The time spent with adverse levels of the risk factor often \ncauses irreversible damage that precludes complete restoration of low \nrisk. For example, individuals with hypertension who are treated back \nto  optimal  levels  (<120/<80  mmHg)  do  have  a  lower  risk  compared \nwith untreated patients with hypertension, but they still have twice the \nrisk of cardiovascular events as those who maintained optimal blood \npressure  without  medications.  Patients  with  elevated  blood  pressure \nthat  is  subsequently  treated  have  greater  left  ventricular  mass  index, \nworse renal function, and more evidence of atherosclerosis and other \ntarget organ damage as a result of the time spent with elevated blood \npressure; such damage cannot be fully reversed despite efficacious ther-\napy with antihypertensive medications. Conversely, as described below \nin greater detail, individuals who maintain optimal levels of all major \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   8\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine \n \n"

Screening  attempts  to  detect  evidence  of  disease  at  its \nearliest stages, when treatment is likely to be more efficacious than for \nadvanced disease (Chap. 6). Screening can be performed in service of \nprevention, especially if it aids in identifying preclinical markers, such \nas dyslipidemia or hyperglycemia, associated with elevated disease risk.\n\n \u25a0 HEALTH PROMOTION\nIn recent decades, medical practice has increasingly focused on clinical \nand public health approaches to promote health, and not just prevent \ndisease. Prevention of disease is a worthy individual and societal goal \nin and of itself, but it does not necessarily guarantee health. Health is \na broader construct encompassing more than just absence of disease. \nIt  includes  biologic,  physiologic,  and  psychological  domains  (among \nothers) in a continuum, rather than occurring as a dichotomous trait. \nHealth is therefore somewhat subjective, but attempts have been made \nto use more objective criteria to define health in order to raise aware-\nness, prevent disease, and promote healthy longevity.\n\nFor  example,  in  2010,  the  American  Heart  Association  (AHA) \ndefined a new construct of \u201ccardiovascular health\u201d based on evidence \nof associations with longevity, disease avoidance, healthy longevity, and \nquality of life. The definition of cardiovascular health is based on seven \nhealth  behaviors  and  health  factors  (eating  pattern,  physical  activity, \nsmoking status, body mass index [BMI], and levels of blood pressure, \nblood  cholesterol,  and  blood  glucose)  and  includes  a  spectrum  from \npoor  to  ideal.  Individuals  with  optimal  levels  of  all  seven  metrics \nsimultaneously are considered to have ideal cardiovascular health. The \nstate of cardiovascular health for an individual or a population can be \nassessed with simple scoring by counting the number of ideal metrics \n(out of seven) or applying 0 points for each poor metric, 1 point for \neach  intermediate  metric,  and  2  points  for  each  ideal  metric,  thus \ncreating  a  composite  cardiovascular  health  score  ranging  from  0  to \n14 points. Higher cardiovascular health scores in younger and middle \nages  have  been  associated  with  greater  longevity,  lower  incidence  of \ncardiovascular  disease,  lower  incidence  of  other  chronic  diseases  of \naging (including dementia, cancer, and more), compression of morbid-\nity, greater quality of life, and lower health care costs, achieving both \nindividual and societal goals for healthy aging and further establishing \nthe  critical  importance  of  primordial  prevention  and  cardiovascular \nhealth promotion.\n\nFocusing on health promotion, rather than just disease prevention, \nmay  also  provide  greater  motivation  for  patients  to  pursue  lifestyle \nchanges or adhere to clinician recommendations. Extensive literature \nsuggests  that  providing  patients  solely  with  information  regarding \ndisease risk, or risk reduction with treatment, is unlikely to motivate \ndesired  behavior  change.  Empowering  patients  with  strategies  to \nachieve  positive  health  goals  after  discussing  risks  can  provide  more \neffective  adherence  and  better  long-term  outcomes.  In  the  case  of \nsmoking  cessation,  enumerating  only  the  risks  of  smoking  can  lead \nto  patient  inertia  and  therapeutic  nihilism  and  has  proven  to  be  an \nineffective  approach,  whereas  strategies  that  incorporate  positive \nhealth  messaging,  support,  and  feedback,  with  appropriate  use  of  \nevidence-based therapies, have proven far more effective.\n\n \u25a0 PRIORITIZING PREVENTION STRATEGIES\nIn  secondary  prevention,  the  patient  already  has  manifest  clinical  dis-\nease and is therefore at high risk for progression. The approach should \nbe to work with the patient to implement all evidence-based strategies \nthat  will  help  to  prevent  recurrence  or  progression.  This  will  typically \ninclude drug therapy as well as therapeutic lifestyle changes to control \nongoing  risk  factors  that  may  have  caused  disease  in  the  first  place. \nJuggling  priorities  can  be  difficult,  and  barriers  to  implementation  are \nmany,  including  costs,  time,  patient  health  literacy,  and  patient  and \ncaregiver  capacity  to  organize  the  regimen.  Addressing  these  poten-\ntial  barriers  with  the  patient  can  help  to  forge  a  therapeutic  bond  and \n\nmay  improve  adherence;  ignoring  them  will  likely  lead  to  therapeutic \nfailure.  Numerous  studies  demonstrate  that,  even  in  high-functioning \nhealth  systems,  only  ~50%  of  patients  are  taking  recommended,  \nevidence-based secondary prevention medications, such as statins, by \n1 year after a myocardial infarction.\n\nIn patients who are eligible for primary prevention strategies, it is \nimportant  to  frame  the  discussion  around  the  overall  evidence  base \nas  well  as  an  individual  patient\u2019s  likelihood  of  benefit  from  a  given \npreventive  intervention.  A  first  step  is  to  understand  the  patient\u2019s \nestimated absolute risk for disease in the foreseeable future or during \ntheir remaining life span. However, absolute risk estimation and pre-\nsentation of those risks are generally insufficient to motivate behavior \nchange. It is critical to assess the patient\u2019s understanding and tolerance \nof  the  risk,  their  readiness  to  implement  lifestyle  changes  or  adhere \nto  drug  therapy,  and  their  overall  preferences  regarding  use  of  drug \ntherapy to prevent an event (e.g., cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke). \nThe clinician can help the patient by informing them of the risks for \ndisease and potential for absolute benefits (and harms) from the avail-\nable evidence-based choices. This may take more than one conversa-\ntion, but given that diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, \nare the leading causes of premature death and disability, the time is well  \nspent.\n\nPartnering  with  the  patient  through  motivational  interviewing \nmay assist in the process of selecting initial approaches to prevention. \nSelecting an area that the patient feels they are ready to change can lead \nto better adherence and greater achievement of success in the short and \nlonger term. If the patient is uncertain what course to choose, prudence \nwould dictate focusing on control of risk factors that may lead to the \nmost rapid reduction in risk for acute events. For example, blood pres-\nsure is both a chronic risk factor and an acute trigger for cardiovascular \nevents. Thus, if a patient has both significant elevations in blood pres-\nsure and dyslipidemia, it would be appropriate to focus initial efforts \non blood pressure control. Likewise, a focus on smoking cessation can \nlead to more rapid reductions in risk for acute events than some other \nlifestyle interventions.\n\n \u25a0 PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION ACROSS \nTHE LIFE COURSE\nPeriodic Health Evaluations  The \u201croutine annual physical\u201d has \nin many ways become an expected part of the patient-physician rela-\ntionship in primary care practice. However, evidence for the efficacy \nof  the  periodic  health  evaluation  in  asymptomatic  adults  unselected \nfor  risk  factors  or  disease  is  mixed  and  depends  on  the  outcome. \nSystematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  of  published  trials  have  con-\nsistently observed lack of benefit (and also lack of harm) in terms of \ntotal  mortality  in  association  with  periodic  health  evaluations.  Data \nare more heterogeneous but overall suggest no benefit for cancer- or \ncardiovascular-specific mortality, with the potential for either benefit \nor harm depending on number of evaluations and patient-level factors. \nWell-designed studies on nonfatal clinical events and morbidity have \nbeen sparsely reported, but there appear to be no large effects.\n\nPeriodic health evaluations do appear to lead to greater diagnosis of \ncertain conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, as expected. \nLikewise,  periodic  health  examinations  also  improve  the  delivery  of \nrecommended  preventive  services,  such  as  gynecologic  examinations \nand  Papanicolaou  smears,  fecal  occult  blood  testing,  and  cholesterol \nscreening.  The  benefits  and  risks  associated  with  screening  tests  are \ndiscussed  in  detail  in  Chap.  6.  Risks  of  routine  evaluations  include \ninappropriate  testing  or  overtesting  or  false-positive  findings  that \nrequire follow-up and induce patients to worry. Periodic health exami-\nnations  appear  to  be  associated  with  less  patient  worry.  On  balance, \ngiven  the  lack  of  convincing  evidence  of  harm  and  the  potential  for \nbetter  delivery  of  appropriate  screening,  counseling,  and  preventive \nservices,  periodic  health  evaluations  appear  reasonable  for  general \npopulations at average risk for chronic conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that routine annual comprehensive physical \nexaminations of asymptomatic adult patients have very low yield and \nmay take an inordinate amount of time in a wellness visit.

For the first 6 months of life, infants should \nexclusively be fed human milk, or iron-fortified \nformula if human milk is unavailable. From 6 to  \n12 months, infants should be introduced to a \nvariety of complementary nutrient-dense foods. \nFrom 12 months to older adulthood, the dietary \npattern should meet nutrient needs, help achieve \na healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of \nchronic disease.\n\n2.   Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and \n\nbeverage choices to reflect personal preferences, \ncultural traditions, and budgetary considerations. \nThe Dietary Guidelines provide a framework of \nseveral dietary patterns intended to be customized \nto individual needs and preferences, as well as \nthe foodways of the diverse cultures in the United \nStates.\n\n3.   Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-\ndense foods and beverages, and stay within \ncalorie limits. Nutrient-dense foods provide \nvitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting \ncomponents and have no or little added sugars, \nsaturated fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary \npattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of \nfoods and beverages across all food groups, in \nrecommended amounts, and within calorie limits.\n4.   Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, \nsaturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic \nbeverages. At every life stage, meeting food group \nrecommendations, even with nutrient-dense \nchoices, fulfills most of a person\u2019s daily calorie \nneeds and sodium limits, with little room for extra \nadded sugars, saturated fat, or sodium, or for \nalcoholic beverages.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe Dietary Guidelines\u2019 Key Recommendations for healthy eating patterns should be applied in their \nentirety, given the interconnected relationship that each dietary component can have with others. They are \nalso intended as a framework to accommodate personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary \nconsiderations.\nFocus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages, and stay within calorie limits to \nachieve a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\nThe core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:\n\u2022\t Vegetables of all types\u2014dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other vegetables\n\u2022\t Fruits, especially whole fruit\n\u2022\t Grains, at least half of which are whole grain\n\u2022\t Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified soy \n\nbeverages and yogurt as alternatives\n\n\u2022\t Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and \n\nsoy products\n\n\u2022\t Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts\nA healthy eating pattern limits:\n\u2022\t Added sugars\u2014Less than 10% of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with added \n\nsugars for those younger than age 2.\n\n\u2022\t Saturated fat\u2014Less than 10% of calories per day starting at age 2.\n\u2022\t Sodium\u2014Less than 2300 mg per day\u2014and even less for children younger than age 14.\n\u2022\t Alcoholic beverages\u2014Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by \nlimiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is \nconsumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink \nalcohol, such as women who are pregnant.\n\nMeet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\nIn tandem with the recommendations above, Americans of all ages\u2014children, adolescents, adults, and older \nadults\u2014should meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to help promote health and reduce the \nrisk of chronic disease. Americans should aim to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. The relationship \nbetween diet and physical activity contributes to calorie balance and managing body weight. \n\nSource: Adapted from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; \n2020. Available at https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf.\n\nmay be better spent on assessing and counseling the patient on other \naspects of their health, as discussed below. Evidence-based components \nthat should be included in periodic evaluations focused on health and \nprevention  include  a  number  of  age-appropriate  screening  tests  for \nchronic  disease  and  risk  factors,  preventive  interventions  including \nimmunizations and chemoprevention for at-risk individuals, and pre-\nventive counseling. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force publishes \nits Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, which contains evidence-based \nrecommendations  from  the  Task  Force  on  preventive  services  for \nwhich  there  is  a  high  degree  of  certainty  that  the  service  provides  at \nleast  moderate  net  clinical  benefit  (i.e.,  benefits  outweigh  harms  sig-\nnificantly and to a reasonable magnitude).\nHealthy  Behaviors  and  Lifestyles  Owing  to  the  paucity  of \nevidence,  the  heterogeneity  of  study  designs,  and  the  diverse  nature \nof  interventions  studied,  many  clinicians  are  uncertain  as  to  how  to \ndeliver advice regarding healthy behaviors and lifestyles. Nevertheless, \nadverse  behaviors  and  lifestyles  contribute  to  >75%  of  premature, \npreventable  deaths  and  disability.  Estimates  from  the  U.S.  National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that fewer than 1% \nof  Americans  achieve  an  optimal  heart-healthy  eating  pattern.  Thus, \nwhereas  there  are  many  demands  on  time  during  a  typical  patient-\nclinician  encounter,  few  things  may  have  more  impact  on  longevity, \nhealth, and quality of life for asymptomatic patients than an efficient \napproach  to  assessing,  documenting,  and  improving  patients\u2019  health \nbehaviors.  Indeed,  the  mere  act  of  assessing  health  behaviors  has \nbeen shown to affect patients\u2019 health behaviors. Facility with tools for \nassessment of lifestyle and with strategies for counseling are therefore \nof paramount importance.\nHealthy Eating Patterns (see Chap. 332)  Despite the existence \nof numerous \u201cfad\u201d diets and seemingly inconsistent recommendations \n\non  dietary  composition,  there  is  remarkable  agreement  about  what \nshould constitute a healthy eating pattern for the broad population to \navoid  nutritional  deficits  (i.e.,  vitamin  deficiency)  and  excesses  (i.e., \nexcessive caloric intake) and to maximize potential health (Table 2-1). \nOptimal eating patterns consist of whole fruits and vegetables, whole \ngrains, lean proteins, and healthy oils, and allow for nonfat or low-fat \ndairy intake. They tend to exclude frequent ingestion of foods high in \nrefined sugars and starches, saturated fat, and sodium. Since sodium \nand  refined  sugars  and  starches  are  the  hallmark  of  much  of  the  \nprocessed/packaged food supply, a simple rule of thumb is to provide \nor cook the majority of one\u2019s own meals starting from whole foods and \nemphasizing fruits and vegetables. Likewise, foods prepared outside of \nthe home tend to have higher fat and sodium content, so special atten-\ntion to menu choices focused on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and \nwhole  grains,  while  minimizing  sauces  and  dressings,  can  help  most \nindividuals follow healthier eating patterns when eating food prepared \noutside the home. In all cases, sugar-sweetened beverages and nonnu-\ntritious snack foods should be minimized. If snacks are included, small \namounts of healthy nuts and seeds or more fruits and vegetables should \nbe encouraged.\n\nSpecific conditions and diseases, such as diabetes, other metabolic \ndisorders, allergies, and gastrointestinal disorders, may require tailored \napproaches to diet. In counseling most patients, the general approach \nshould focus on whole foods, eating patterns, and appropriate calorie \nbalance, rather than on specific micronutrients such as electrolytes or \nselected  vitamins.  It  should  be  remembered  that  most  patients  have \ndifficulty understanding nutritional labels on packaged foods, with the \nattendant demands on numeracy and health literacy.\n\nDietary  guidelines  are  published  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agri-\nculture  (USDA)  and  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Ser-\nvices  every  5  years,  and  these  guidelines  have  undergone  substantial \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   10\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine\u00a0\n"

The  current  U.S.  Dietary  Guidelines  and  Key \nRecommendations  for  2020\u20132025  are  summarized  in  Table  2-1  and \nemphasize the importance of healthy eating patterns for every stage of \nlife, to avoid chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and \ncardiovascular disease. The core elements include eating patterns with \nnutrient-dense (rather than calorie-dense) whole foods and appropri-\nate caloric intake to achieve and maintain healthy weight. The USDA \nguidelines focus on the concept of a healthy plate (rather than the prior \nfood  pyramid)  for  ease  of  counseling  and  adoption.  Fifty  percent  of \nthe plate should consist of vegetables and whole fruits, with remaining \nportions for whole grains and lean protein foods. When using fat for \ncooking, it should be done by sauteing in healthier oils (e.g., canola oil), \nand addition of judicious amounts of healthy raw oils (e.g., olive oil, \nnuts) to dishes is appropriate. Recommendations also focus on limita-\ntion of foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and \nsodium, and moderation or avoidance of alcohol intake.\n\nThe  USDA  guidelines  focus  on  specific  healthy  eating  patterns  that \nadhere to these broad recommendations and are appropriate for ~97% \nof  the  general  population.  They  identify  a  \u201cHealthy  U.S.-Style  Dietary \nPattern\u201d that adheres closely to the evidence-based Dietary Approaches \nto Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern but is customizable for dif-\nferent cultural or personal preferences. Alternative patterns, which vary \nmore  in  emphasis  than  in  content,  include  a  \u201cHealthy  Mediterranean-\nStyle Dietary Pattern\u201d and a \u201cHealthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern.\u201d\nAGE- AND SEX-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  Current dietary frame-\nwork  recommendations  are  generally  similar  for  all  life  stages  from \nages \u226512 months, but recommended levels of caloric intake (and hence \namounts  of  foods)  differ  by  age,  sex,  and  physical  activity  level.  For \nexample, recommended caloric intake ranges from 1000 calories/d for \nsedentary 2-year-old children to as high as 3200 calories/d for active \n16- to 18-year-old young men. Recommended caloric intakes peak in \nlate adolescence or early adulthood for men and women and gradually \ndecrease over ensuing decades.\n\nAs  with  all  lifestyle  counseling  aimed  at  behavior  change,  dietary \napproaches that partner with the patient and utilize motivational inter-\nviewing  strategies  and  shared  goals  and  commitments  tend  to  work \nbest, as described below (see \u201cApproach to the Patient\u201d).\n\nPhysical Activity  Similar to the approach to counseling regarding \nhealthy eating patterns, recommendations on participation in physical \nactivity  emphasize  the  point  that  any  physical  activity  is  better  than \nnone. A simple rule of thumb for patients is: \u201cIf you are doing nothing, \ndo  something;  and  if  you  are  doing  something,  do  more,  every  day.\u201d \nThe evidence base for physical activity indicates that the marginal ben-\nefits from physical activity are greatest in advancing from no activity to \nlow levels of moderate activity. With increasing duration and intensity \nof activity, there is a continued curvilinear increase in health benefits, \nbut  the  marginal  gains  for  each  additional  minute  of  moderate-to- \nvigorous activity slowly diminish. Thus, for adults, the recommended \namount of physical activity is 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min \nof vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, performed in episodes \nof  at  least  5  min,  and  preferably  spread  throughout  the  week,  plus \nparticipation in muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week. \nAdditional  health  benefits  can  be  realized  by  engaging  in  physical \nactivity beyond this amount.\n\nIn counseling patients regarding physical activity, it is important to \nnote that sedentary time (e.g., seated at work or at home in front of elec-\ntronic screens) has adverse health consequences independent of the lack \nof physical activity during these episodes. Therefore, even modest efforts \nlike standing at the desk and doing gentle stretching for periods during \nthe day may be beneficial. It is also important to emphasize that par-\nticipating in a variety of aerobic activities (biking, swimming, walking, \njogging, rowing, elliptical training, stair-climbing, etc.) can be beneficial \nand may help to avoid overuse injuries and boredom with the exercise \nregimen. If patients choose to participate in muscle-strengthening activ-\nities  for  health  improvement,  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  weights \nthat allow more repetitions (e.g., 3 sets of 15\u201320 repetitions that can be \nperformed comfortably, with a rest period in between) and on avoiding \nbreath-holding and straining against a closed glottis.\n\nSUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH RISK  Patients may express concerns regard-\ning the risk of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Whereas the risk \nof sudden death during exercise does increase directly with the amount \nof time spent exercising, this association is substantially mitigated by \ntraining  effects.  Thus,  patients  embarking  on  an  exercise  program \nshould be encouraged to increase the duration of aerobic exercise grad-\nually as tolerated, aiming for episodes of at least 30 min 5 times a week \nas  an  ideal.  Once  a  comfortable  duration  is  reached,  incorporating \ninterval training periods of more intensive activity interspersed during \nthe exercise can provide greater fitness gains.\n\nEXTREME ENDURANCE ACTIVITIES  As with other forms of exercise, \nextreme endurance activities such as triathlons and marathons should \nbe undertaken only with appropriate and graded training. Such activi-\nties tend to take a greater toll on the musculoskeletal system over time \nthan  less  extreme  activities,  and  they  are  also  associated  with  mea-\nsurable damage to the myocardium and greater risks for other organ \ndamage.  Athletes  participating  in  endurance  activities  routinely  have \nelevations in cardiac troponin (a specific circulating marker of myocar-\ndial cell damage and death) at the end of the race, although elevations \nare lower in those who are well trained. Patients and clinicians should \nconsider the patient\u2019s overall health, specific limitations, potential for \ninjury, and ability to train in decision-making regarding participation \nin endurance events.\n\nAGE-SPECIFIC  RECOMMENDATIONS  The  U.S.  Department  of  Health \nand Human Services\u2019 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, second \nedition  (2018)  (Table  2-2),  recommend  that  preschool-aged  children \n(aged 3\u20135 years) should be physically active throughout the day in a vari-\nety of activity types to enhance growth and development. Children and \nadolescents aged 6\u201317 years should participate in \u226560 min of physical \nactivity daily, most of which should be moderate- or vigorous-intensity \naerobic activity, including vigorous, muscle-strengthening, and bone-\nstrengthening  activities  at  least  3  days  a  week  each.  As  noted  above, \nadults aged 18\u201364 years are recommended to pursue at least 150 min \nof moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity \nper week (or equivalent combinations), with at least 2 days of muscle-\nstrengthening activities. Adults aged \u226565 years should follow the adult \nguidelines or be as active as possible as abilities and conditions allow. \nFor  older  adults,  special  emphasis  is  also  placed  on  multicomponent \nphysical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and \nmuscle-strengthening activities.\n\nSleep Hygiene  Sleeping between 7 and 9 h per night appears to be \noptimal for health in adults aged \u226518 years. Sleeping <7 h is associated \nwith  adverse  outcomes,  including  obesity,  diabetes,  elevated  blood \npressure,  cardiovascular  disease,  depression,  and  all-cause  mortality, \nas well as physiologic disturbances such as impaired immune function, \nincreased pain sensitivity, and impaired cognitive performance. Con-\nversely,  achieving  appropriate  levels  of  sleep  is  associated  with  more \nsuccess  in  weight  loss,  better  blood  pressure  control  among  patients \nwith  hypertension,  and  improved  mental  health  and  performance. \nRegular sleep more than 9 h per night is appropriate for children and \nadolescents or individuals recovering from sleep deprivation or illness, \nbut for most individuals, the effects on health are uncertain.\n\nPatients  often  express  concerns  about  the  quantity  and  quality  of \ntheir sleep. With aging, both aspects of sleep tend to decline, even with-\nout overt sleep disorders. Documentation of sleep using a sleep log may \nassist in understanding different types of insomnia and sleep disorders. \nEncouraging daily activity to promote fatigue, avoidance of eating and \ndrinking  alcohol  too  close  to  bedtime,  and  regular  daily  sleep  habits \nmay help patients achieve better sleep. Regular use of sedative medi-\ncations  should  generally  be  discouraged  given  the  high  potential  for \ndependence, addiction, and altered sleep quality.\n\nDISORDERS  OF  SLEEP  The  prevalence  of  sleep-related  breathing \ndisorders,  including  obstructive  sleep  apnea  (OSA),  is  poorly  docu-\nmented. A recent systematic review suggested that that the prevalence \nof  clinically  important  OSA  in  the  general  adult  population  may  be \nbetween 9% and 38%, with higher rates in men versus women, older \nversus  younger  adults,  and  those  with  higher  versus  lower  BMI. \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   11\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n"

Some physical activity is better than none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of \n\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits.\n\n\u2022\t For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 min (2 h and 30 min) to 300 min (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity or 75 min  \n(1 h and 15 min) to 150 min (2 h and 30 min) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- \nand vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.\n\n\u2022\t Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 min (5 h) of moderate-intensity physical \n\nactivity a week.\n\n\u2022\t Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more \n\ndays a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.\n\n\u226565 years\n\n\u2022\t The key guidelines for adults also apply to older adults. In addition, the following key guidelines are just for older adults:\n\n\u2022\t As part of their weekly physical activity, older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as \n\naerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.\n\n\u2022\t Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness.\n\u2022\t Older adults with chronic conditions should understand whether and how their conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity \n\nsafely.\n\n\u2022\t When older adults cannot do 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as \n\nphysically active as their abilities and conditions allow.\n\nModerate-intensity physical activity: Aerobic activity that increases a person\u2019s heart rate and breathing to some extent. On a scale relative to a person\u2019s capacity, \nmoderate-intensity activity is usually a 5 or 6 on a 0 to 10 scale. Brisk walking, dancing, swimming, or bicycling on a level terrain are examples. Vigorous-intensity physical \nactivity: Aerobic activity that greatly increases a person\u2019s heart rate and breathing. On a scale relative to a person\u2019s capacity, vigorous-intensity activity is usually a 7 or 8 \non a 0 to 10 scale. Jogging, singles tennis, swimming continuous laps, or bicycling uphill are examples. Muscle-strengthening activity: Physical activity, including exercise \nthat increases skeletal muscle strength, power, endurance, and mass. It includes strength training, resistance training, and muscular strength and endurance exercises. \nBone-strengthening activity: Physical activity that produces an impact or tension force on bones, which promotes bone growth and strength. Running, jumping rope, and \nlifting weights are examples.\nSource: Adapted from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services; 2018. Available at https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf.\n\nPatients  with  persistent  complaints  of  poor  sleep  quality  or  excessive \ndaytime somnolence or with witnessed apneic spells may benefit from \nscreening for sleep disorders, prior to consideration of a formal sleep \nstudy.  A  number  of  clinical  tools  have  been  developed  to  screen  for \nsleep apnea, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the STOP (snoring, \ntiredness, observed apnea, high blood pressure) Questionnaire, and the \nSTOP-Bang  Questionnaire  (STOP  plus  assessment  of  BMI,  age,  neck \ncircumference, and gender), among others. The U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force found that current evidence is insufficient to assess the bal-\nance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults \nowing to a lack of validation data in primary care settings. Nonetheless, \nthe high prevalence and significant health consequences of sleep apnea \nsuggest that clinicians should be alert for its potential presence, partic-\nularly  in  patients  who  are  obese  with  symptoms  of  excessive  daytime \nsomnolence or witnessed apnea episodes. Other sleep disorders, such as \nrestless leg syndrome, may be identified with simple history.\n\nWeight  Management  Overweight  and  obesity  are  prevalent  in \nepidemic  proportions  in  the  United  States  and  other  industrialized \nnations  (Chaps. 401  and 402).  Since  1985,  the  prevalence  of  obesity \nin  the  United  States  has  increased  from  ~10  to  ~35%,  and  the  prev-\nalence  of  overweight  is  now  ~40%.  Overweight  and  obesity  dispro-\nportionately  affect  individuals  in  lower  socioeconomic  strata  and  in \nmany underserved minority populations, including black Americans, \nLatino  Americans,  and  American  Indians.  In  all  race/ethnic  groups, \nboth overweight and obesity are associated with adverse health conse-\nquences,  including  diabetes,  certain  cancers,  cardiovascular  diseases, \nand degenerative joint disease. Eating disorders such as anorexia and \nbulimia  are  much  less  common  but  pose  major  health  consequences \n\nfor affected patients and should be suspected particularly in younger \nwomen with history of rapid weight shifts or underweight status.\n\nWeight loss is one of the most difficult preventive interventions to \nachieve and sustain over time. However, several key factors can assist \nthe patient and clinician, and early referral to a dietician can be very \nhelpful.  The  first  therapeutic  goal  is  to  aim  for  weight  stabilization. \nMany of the risks of overweight and obesity are driven more strongly \nby continued weight gain, rather than overweight/obese status per se. \nWorking with the patient to find initial strategies for weight mainte-\nnance can be a successful initial step with success for many patients. \nFor  those  who  can  progress  to  considering  weight  loss,  it  is  critical \nto  help  the  patient  understand  that  there  is  no  standard  solution. \nExperimentation  and  documentation  are  key.  Tools  to  assist  patients \ncan include food and weight logs, activity logs, and smart phone apps. \nSome patients respond best to structured approaches such as intermit-\ntent fasting regimens or commercial dietary programs where meals are \nprovided. Any of these approaches can be tried with or without social \ngroup supports.\n\nThe key construct for weight loss is, of course, negative calorie bal-\nance. This is achieved through a combination of reduced caloric intake \nand increased physical activity. Patients may already understand, from \nprior weight loss attempts, what combination works best for them to \nachieve this. Some patients find that they cannot lose weight without \nincreasing their exercise. For many, reduction of caloric intake is most \nefficient. Encouraging the patient to find what works for them is most \nimportant.  The  same  principle  holds  for  dietary  content.  Well-done \nfeeding studies indicate that weight loss is dependent far more on the \nreduction of caloric intake than on the relative composition of fat, pro-\ntein, and carbohydrate in the diet. There may be other medical reasons \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   12\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

    "text": "to  choose  one  approach  over  another,  but  if  not,  encouraging  the \npatient to pick one approach and document the results is an important \nstart. Once weight loss is achieved, increase in activity is often required \nfor its successful maintenance.\n\nTobacco Cessation (see Chap. 454)  Escaping  nicotine  depen-\ndence  is  another  major,  but  critical,  challenge  to  prevention  and \nwellness  efforts.  The  addictive  effects  of  nicotine  have  been  well \ndocumented,  with  effects  that  can  last  for  years  after  successful  ces-\nsation.  Assessing  a  patient\u2019s  past  history  of  cessation  attempts  and \ncurrent readiness for change are key first steps in forging a successful \napproach.  Frequent  follow-up  and  reinforcement,  as  well  as  use  of \nnicotine  replacement  therapy  and  other  cessation-promoting  medi-\ncations,  are  additional  critical  elements.  Recidivism  is  the  rule,  and \npatients should expect to resume smoking and attempt again as they \njourney to tobacco cessation. Electronic cigarettes have some evidence \nfor  benefit  in  adult  smoking  cessation,  but  their  potential  for  use  by \nadolescents and young adults who are not smokers represents a major \npublic  health  threat  for  a  new  generation  of  nicotine  addiction,  with \nunknown  health  consequences  as  a  result  of  the  high  doses  of  nico-\ntine  delivered  to  developing  organs,  including  the  brain.  Vaping  of \nother substances, often in association with flavoring compounds, has \nalso been associated with pulmonary and cardiovascular damage and \nshould be actively discouraged.\n\n \u25a0 VACCINATION (CHAP. 123)\nOne  of  the  major  advances  in  public  health  that  has  contributed  to \nincreases in health and longevity worldwide is the development of safe \nand  effective  vaccinations  against  endemic  and  epidemic  infectious \ndiseases. Patients should be counseled regarding age-appropriate vac-\ncinations for their children and for themselves. Some individuals may \nbe  reluctant  to  receive  a  vaccination;  in  these  cases,  listening  to  the \npatient\u2019s concerns is important, followed by explanation of the benefits \nto the individual, their family, and their community and review of the \nlow risk for potential harms. It is true to say that no current vaccines \nare ever worse than the disease they prevent, although side effects may \noccur rarely. Thorough knowledge of the data on side effect rates and \nof  efficacy  will  aid  the  clinician  in  helping  the  patient  make  a  fully \ninformed decision.\n\n \u25a0 MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION\nAssessment  for  depression  and  cognitive  impairment  is  important \nto  address  when  patients  exhibit  symptoms  or  they  or  their  family \nmembers express concerns. Both of these common conditions play a \nmajor role in reducing quality of life and are high on patients\u2019 lists of \nconcerns, even if not clearly expressed. Screening tools for depression \nare reviewed in Chap. 452. Cognitive function decline with aging or \ncomorbid illness, including depression, should be anticipated. Assess-\nment tools such as the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition \nor the Mini-CogTM test are widely available and effective rapid assess-\nment tools.\n\nAlcohol  and  Opioids  (see  Chaps.  453  and  456)  Alcohol \ndependence  and  abuse  are  common  and  underdiagnosed.  Rapid \nscreening tools have proven efficacy for identifying patients with alco-\nhol problems. In a systematic review, the CAGE (cut down, annoyed, \nguilty,  eye  opener)  questionnaire  was  most  effective  at  identifying \nalcohol  abuse  and  dependence,  with  reasonable  sensitivity  and  high \nspecificity. The present opioid epidemic in the United States presents \na new and substantial public health challenge given the high potential \nfor  dependency  and  abuse  of  these  drugs.  Rapid  screening  tools  are \navailable to assist clinicians in screening for opioid dependence.\n\n \u25a0 ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDE\nRegular  assessment  of  patient  safety  through  simple  questions  about \nseat belt use, domestic violence, and gun safety in the home continues \nto  be  an  important  part  of  health  promotion  and  wellness.  Long-\nstanding recommendations for assessment of suicidal ideation among \npatients with depression or a history of suicide attempts also continue \nto be relevant.\n\n13\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n3\n\nV\na\nc\nc\ni\nn\ne\nO\np\np\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nn\nd\nH\ne\ns\ni\nt\na\nn\nc\ny\n\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT\nIn the context of a clinical visit focused on health assessment, health \npromotion,  and  prevention,  the  basic  skills  of  history-taking  are \nof  paramount  importance.  Much  of  the  evaluation,  counseling, \nand  management  that  focus  on  health  promotion  and  prevention \nalso  require  engagement  and  buy-in  from  the  patient  in  order  to \nassist  with  recognition  of  contributing  behaviors  and  to  promote \nadherence to therapeutic plans. Therefore, in addition to standard \nhistory-taking,  additional  skills  such  as  motivational  interviewing \nand  eliciting  patient  commitments  and  contracting  may  prove  of \nsignificant  value.  The  availability  of  additional  tools  to  assist  with \nscreening, monitoring, and chronic management, both online and \nthrough  wearable  devices  and  mobile  health  technologies,  is  rap-\nidly  expanding,  with  uncertain  implications  for  the  future.  Major \nresearch gaps exist in our understanding of how best to employ these \nnewer technologies to improve health outcomes. Concepts of behav-\nioral  economics  are  being  explored  to  better  understand  the  psy-\nchology of decision-making and incentives as a means to improve \nlifestyle choices and adherence to treatment plans (Chap. 481).\n\nThe  limited  time  available  to  clinicians  and  patients  during  a \nwellness  visit  or  periodic  health  examination  (not  driven  by  spe-\ncific patient issues) makes it important to prioritize assessment and \ncounseling for factors that affect longevity, health span, and quality \nof life over approaches that may have low yield, such as the annual \ncomprehensive  physical  examination  in  an  asymptomatic  patient. \nSetting clear expectations for the content of a wellness visit may be \na first step, and scheduling follow-up visits for findings or to con-\ntinue indicated counseling are important steps to achieving better \nhealth outcomes.\n\n \u25a0 FURTHER READING\nBoulware LE et al: Systematic review: The value of the periodic health \n\nevaluation.

Dramatic declines in the morbidity and \nmortality of vaccine-preventable diseases have been observed, and the \ncontribution of vaccines to the elimination, control, and prevention of \ninfectious disease cannot be overstated. However, opposition and hes-\nitancy to vaccines exist and are not new. Vaccine hesitancy has existed \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   13\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

So  why  did  the  World  Health  Organization \nrank these attitudes as one of the ten greatest threats to public health in \n2019? Are current opposition and hesitancy any different from what has \nbeen seen before? Many sociologists, public health experts, and health \ncare  providers  (HCPs)  argue  yes.  Recent  social  and  cultural  trends, \ncombined with new communication formats, have converged to create \na particularly potent form of hesitancy and what some have labeled a \ncrisis of confidence. This crisis manifests as a lack of trust in specific \nvaccines, vaccine programs, researchers, HCPs, the health care system, \npharmaceutical  companies,  academics,  policymakers,  governments, \nand authority in general. (See \u201cFocus: COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,\u201d \nbelow.)\n\nThe roots of modern vaccine hesitancy and opposition\u2014defined as \ndelay or rejection of vaccines in spite of availability\u2014vary depending \non the place and the population. For some individuals and communi-\nties, pseudoscience and false claims about the safety of existing vaccines \n(e.g., an unsupported link between measles vaccine and autism) have \ndriven fears, increased hesitancy, and decreased acceptance. For others, \nreal safety events, such as the association of narcolepsy with a specific \npandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix), have justified concerns. In a \nfew locations (e.g., Ukraine, Pakistan), vaccine hesitancy is the result \nof failed health systems or even state failures. Finally, for some groups, \nincluding  some  fundamentalist  religious  groups  and  alternative- \nculture  communities,  vaccine  hesitancy  and  opposition  reflect  exclu-\nsion  from  and  rejection  of  mainstream  society  and  allopathic  health \ncare  and  manifest  as  a  deep  distrust  of  these  institutions  and  their \nHCPs. Although the genesis of modern vaccine hesitancy is multifac-\ntorial,  its  outcomes  are  uniform:  a  decrease  in  vaccine  demand  and \nuptake,  a  decrease  in  coverage  by  childhood  and  adult  vaccines,  and \nan increase in vaccine-preventable diseases, outbreaks, and epidemics \nof  disease.  Addressing  this  crisis  and  moving  people  from  vaccine \nhesitancy and refusal to acceptance and active demand require inter-\nvention at multiple levels: the individual, the health system (including \npublic health), and the state.\n\nThis  chapter  will  define  vaccine  hesitancy  and  briefly  describe  its \ndeterminants  and  effects  in  North  America  (the  United  States  and \nCanada). Physicians and other HCPs are well positioned to address the \n\ncrisis of confidence many patients feel toward HCPs and the health care \nsystem. Studies demonstrate that an unambiguous, strong recommen-\ndation by trusted HCPs is most often the reason that patients, includ-\ning  those  who  are  vaccine  hesitant,  choose  to  vaccinate.  Strategies \nfor  counseling  vaccine-hesitant  and  vaccine-resistant  patients  will  be \npresented and examples of strong vaccine recommendations provided. \nPresenting strategies to increase vaccine demand at a system and policy \nlevel is beyond the scope of this chapter. While some physicians may \nhave roles that allow them to act at this level, all physicians can act and \ninfluence  their  individual  patients.  Strategies  to  create  active  vaccine \ndemand at the individual level alone will not solve vaccine hesitancy, \nbut vaccine hesitancy cannot be addressed without these efforts. For \nfurther discussion of immunization principles and vaccine use, see \nChap. 123.\n\n \u25a0 VACCINE COVERAGE AND OUTBREAKS\nThe epidemiologic data from measles outbreaks over the past 10 years \nprovide an interesting illustration of the effects of vaccine opposition \nand hesitancy. For further discussion of measles, see Chap. 205.\n\nNorth  America  Herd  immunity  occurs  when  enough  individuals \nin  a  population  become  immune  to  an  infectious  disease,  usually \nthrough vaccination, that transmission of the infection stops. The level \nof  immunity  (or  level  of  vaccine  coverage)  required  to  confer  herd \nimmunity varies with the specific infectious disease. Because measles is \na highly contagious virus, a coverage rate of 93\u201395% must be achieved \nfor vaccination to confer herd immunity and interrupt measles trans-\nmission.  National  coverage  estimates  place  one-dose  measles  vaccine \ncoverage rates in 2-year-old children at 92% in the United States and \n88%  in  Canada.  In  spite  of  these  relatively  high  levels  of  coverage  in \nyoung  children,  numerous  measles  outbreaks  have  occurred  in  both \ncountries since 2010 (Table 3-1).\n\nThe  vast  majority  (>80%)  of  measles  cases  described  in  Table  3-1 \noccurred  in  under-  or  completely  unvaccinated  individuals.  Of  note, \nmany  of  these  outbreaks  highlight  pockets  of  significantly  under-  or \nunvaccinated individuals that are not apparent in national vaccine cov-\nerage statistics. Moreover, many of the outbreaks listed in Table 3-1 were \nignited  by  unvaccinated  returned  travelers  from  areas  with  existing \n\nTABLE 3-1  Measles Outbreaks in North America\nYEAR/PLACE\n2010/Canada\n\nNO.

    "text": "outbreaks  or  epidemics,  who  spread  disease  into  an  unvaccinated  or \nunder-vaccinated community. Many of the outbreaks were contained \nwithin  the  nonvaccinating  community,  but  several  spread  to  other \nunder-vaccinated  communities  geographically  contiguous  with  the \noutbreak community. More concerning still are the cases and outbreaks \noriginating in communities that had not previously been identified as \nnonvaccinating.  These  cases  likely  highlight  pockets  of  unvaccinated \nindividuals who object for cultural rather than religious reasons. In the \npast,  these  nonvaccinating  individuals  did  not  exist  in  large  enough \nclusters  to  sustain  the  spread  of  measles.  Of  further  concern  is  the \nnumber of individuals included in outbreak statistics who have had one \nor sometimes even two doses of vaccine and who were thought to be \nprotected but who still end up with the disease. The assumption is that \none or two doses provide full disease immunity, but this is not always \ntrue. Often, individual level characteristics (age, immune compromise, \netc.)  affect  the  individual\u2019s  response  to  the  vaccine  and  their  level  of \nprotection. In other instances, vaccine protection can wane over time, \nthus  leaving  fully  immunized  individuals  susceptible  to  infection.  In \nfact, when herd immunity breaks (i.e., the level of immunity in a com-\nmunity becomes too low to prevent transmission of disease), the occur-\nrence of cases even in fully immunized persons is seen, as reflected in \noutbreak statistics. As a result of decreased vaccination rates and the \nresulting disruption of herd immunity, these individuals may become \nmore identifiable as non-immune.\n\nOutside North America  Although overall coverage rates may still \nbe high in North America, they are lower in other parts of the world. In \nSamoa, for example, measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage \nbefore a recent outbreak was 31%; in the Philippines, it was 67%. Twenty \nyears ago, vaccine coverage was sufficiently high in some parts of the \nworld, including Europe, that an unvaccinated traveler from a nonvac-\ncinating community to most regions would have been protected by herd \nimmunity at their destinations. Today that is not the case: such travelers \nare likely to become infected in a country with active measles transmis-\nsion  and  return  home  to  spread  the  infection  into  their  communities \nand  possibly  beyond.  Thus  active  measles  transmission,  whether  at \nhome  or  abroad,  places  individuals  who  rely  on  herd  immunity  (e.g., \nimmunocompromised persons and young infants) at increased risk.\n\n15\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n3\n\nV\na\nc\nc\ni\nn\ne\nO\np\np\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nn\nd\nH\ne\ns\ni\nt\na\nn\nc\ny\n\n \u25a0 FACTORS IN VACCINE HESITANCY\nVaccination  coverage  rates  provide  an  estimate  of  the  proportion  of \nchildren  or  adults  in  the  population  who  have  been  vaccinated,  but \nthey  do  not  indicate  the  proportion  of  individuals  who  are  vaccine \nhesitant.  An  individual  may  be  fully  vaccinated  but  still  be  hesitant \nabout  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  vaccines,  or  an  individual  may \nbe  unvaccinated  as  a  result  of  access  issues  but  may  not  be  hesitant. \nTherefore, in attempts to understand a patient\u2019s lack of vaccination, it is \nimportant to distinguish persons who are hesitant and refuse vaccines \nfrom those who need assistance to access the health care system and \nsuccessfully  complete  vaccination.  To  this  end,  an  understanding  of \nvaccine hesitancy and its determinants is needed.\n\nVaccine hesitancy and opposition are defined by the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy as a \u201cdelay \nin acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination \nservices.\u201d  The  SAGE  group  describes  vaccine  hesitancy  as  \u201ccomplex \nand context specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines.\u201d\n\nIt  is  useful  to  frame  vaccine  acceptance  as  a  continuum  pyramid, \nwith active demand for all vaccines representing the largest group at \nthe bottom of the pyramid and outright refusal of all vaccines depicted \nin the smallest group at the top. In the middle lies vaccine hesitancy, \nin  which  the  degree  of  vaccine  demand  and  acceptance  varies.  For-\ntunately,  for  disease  control  efforts,  most  individuals  fall  within  the \nactive-demand category or, if they are hesitant, still accept all vaccines. \nHesitancy can be influenced by complacency, convenience, and confi-\ndence (Fig. 3-1).\n\nComplacency  is  self-satisfaction  when  accompanied  by  a  lack  of \nawareness  for  real  dangers  or  deficiencies.  Complacency  exists  in \ncommunities  and  individuals  when  the  perceived  risks  of  vaccine- \npreventable diseases are low and vaccination is not deemed a necessary \npreventive action. This attitude can apply to vaccination in general or \nto  specific  vaccines,  such  as  influenza  vaccines.  Actual  or  perceived \nvaccine efficacy and effectiveness contribute to complacency. Patients \nwho  are  complacent  about  vaccine-preventable  diseases  prioritize \nother lifestyle or health factors over vaccination. These individuals can \nbe  influenced  toward  vaccination  by  a  strong  recommendation  from \na trusted HCP or a local influenza outbreak. They can be influenced \naway from vaccination by a vaccine scare or misinformation on social \n\nCharacteristics\n\n\u2022 Strong distrust of health system/pharmaceutical industry/government\n\u2022 Strong-willed and committed against vaccines\n\u2022 Negative or traumatic experiences with HCPs and health system\n\u2022 May use natural approach to health/alternative HCPs\n\u2022 May have strong religious/moral considerations for refusal\n\u2022 May cluster in communities (geographic and online)\n\u2022 Vaccination is very unlikely; alternative strategies to protect individual and community must be discussed.\n\n\u2022 Questions safety and necessity of vaccines\n\u2022 Actively seeks information from many sources\n\u2022 Has con\ufb02icting feelings on whom to trust\n\u2022 Social norm is not vaccinating.\n\u2022 May have had negative or traumatic experience with health system\n\u2022 Vaccination may not occur; a strong trust relationship with HCP and many visits and conversations are\n  required.\n\nRefuses\n\nLate and\nselective\n\nRejects\nvaccines \n\nParticipatory\nCommunication\nApproach\n\n\u2022 Focused on vaccine risks\n\u2022 Conversation with trusted HCP strongly in\ufb02uential\n\u2022 Trusts HCPs\n\u2022 Actively seeking information and wants to verify it\n\u2022 Wants advice speci\ufb01c for their child\n\u2022 Confused by con\ufb02icting information\n\u2022 Social norm is vaccinating, but individual may feel con\ufb02icted by this norm.\n\u2022 Vaccination requires longer conversation and may require multiple visits.\n\u2022 Focused toward vaccine risk\n\u2022 Complacency: low perceived bene\ufb01ts of vaccination\n\u2022 Can move up or down continuum as a result of various in\ufb02uences (HCP\n  recommendation, vaccine scare, outbreak)\n\u2022 Trusts HCPs and health system\n\u2022 Convenience: need few barriers to vaccination\n\u2022 Vaccination requires longer conversation but likely can be performed at same\n  visit; potential exists to move to active demand.\n\n\u2022 Con\ufb01dence\n\u2022 Considers vaccines important\n\u2022 Considers vaccines safe\n\u2022 Trusts HCP/vaccines/health system\n\u2022 Social norm is vaccinating\n\u2022 Very short conversation with HCP about vaccination, in which HCP\n  should address any questions to maintain active-demand status \n\nHesitant \u2013 many\ndoubts and\nconcerns\n\nHesitant \u2013 minor doubts\nand concerns\n\nActive demand \u2013 no doubts or\nconcerns\n\nAccepts\nvaccines \n\nPresumptive\nCommunication\nApproach\n\nFIGURE 3-1  Vaccine acceptance continuum.

    "text": "16 media. Finally, the real or perceived ability of patients to take the action \nrequired for vaccination (i.e., self-efficacy) influences the role compla-\ncency plays in hesitancy and willingness to seek vaccination.\n\nConvenience  is  determined  by  the  degree  to  which  conversations \nabout  vaccination  and  other  services  can  be  provided  in  culturally \nsafe  contexts  that  are  convenient  and  comfortable  for  the  individual. \nClearly,  convenience  varies  by  community,  health  clinic,  and  even \npatient.  Persons  who  are  criticized  or  scolded  for  not  vaccinating \nthemselves or their children may not feel comfortable or safe accessing \nhealth  services.  Factors  such  as  affordability,  geographic  accessibility, \nlanguage, and health literacy are important considerations when eval-\nuating  the  convenience  of  existing  clinical  care.  Any  of  these  factors \ncan  affect  vaccine  acceptance  and  can  push  a  patient  who  has  some \nhesitancy toward vaccinating or not vaccinating.\n\nConfidence is based on trust in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, \nin the health care system that delivers vaccines (including HCPs), and \nin  the  policymakers  or  governments  who  decide  which  vaccines  are \nneeded and used. A continual erosion of confidence around vaccina-\ntion,  health  systems,  and  governments  drives  today\u2019s  hesitancy  and \nhas  been  amplified  by  larger  social  and  cultural  trends  in  medicine, \nparenting, and information availability.\n\n \u25a0 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL TRENDS\nIndividualized Health Care  Over the past 30 years, the focus of \nmedicine  and  health  care  has  shifted  to  patient-oriented,  individual-\nized  care,  with  an  increasing  emphasis  on  treatment  and  prevention \noptions  tailored  to  the  individual  patient.  In  vaccination  programs, \nthis shift has manifested as requests for individualized vaccine recom-\nmendations and customized immunization schedules. The increasing \npersonalization  of  medicine,  while  positive  overall,  has  forced  public \nhealth away from a focus on the community and its common good and \nhas created tension between individual rights and community health.\n\nParenting  Trends  The  desire  for  an  individualized  approach  to \nmedicine and vaccination reflects broader cultural trends concerning \nindividual  risk  management:  accordingly,  the  individual  is  to  blame \nfor bad outcomes, and public institutions cannot be trusted to manage \ntechnological  (i.e.,  vaccine-related)  risks.  This  viewpoint  is  directly \nlinked  with  cultural  shifts  in  parenting  and  social  norms  defining \nwhat it means to be a \u201cgood parent.\u201d The image of a good parent has \nbeen  reframed  to  refer  to  someone  whom  several  investigators  have \ndescribed  as  \u201ca  critical  consumer  of  health  services  and  products, \naccounting for their own individual situation as they see it with little \nregard  for  the  implications  of  their  decision  on  other  children.\u201d  The \narchetypical good parent no longer unquestioningly trusts HCPs and \nother  authorities  and  experts.  According  to  this  social  norm,  \u201cgood \nparents\u201d should seek individual medical advice that is tailored for their \nchild  and  specific  to  that  child\u2019s  needs.  While  in  essence  not  a  bad \nthing, this norm can conflict directly with public health vaccine rec-\nommendations and schedules that are organized to maximize commu-\nnity health and to facilitate efficient provision of care at a community  \nlevel.\n\nTraditional  Media  Newspapers,  radio,  and  television  have  been \ncriticized for their coverage of vaccines and in particular their coverage \nof the alleged link between MMR vaccine and autism. By offering equal \ncoverage  throughout  the  early  to  mid-2000s  for  both  the  scientific \nevidence  and  unproven  claims  of  MMR  vaccine  harms,  traditional \nmedia  outlets  provided  a  forum  and  a  megaphone  for  the  spread  of \npseudoscience.  Equal  coverage  leads  to  false  equivalencies.  Celebrity \nadvocates  further  amplified  the  message  via  this  channel.  The  boost \nthat  traditional  media  provided  to  active  vaccine  resistance  and,  less \ndirectly,  to  vaccine  hesitancy  has  not  been  adequately  measured  but \nmust  be  considered  in  any  discussion  of  vaccine  hesitancy.  After \nheadlines  about  multiple  outbreaks  of  measles  and  other  vaccine- \npreventable  diseases  and  continued  direct  criticism  of  the  equal- \ncoverage approach, some traditional media now reject and attempt to \ndiscredit pseudoscience. The effect this stance will have on increasing \nvaccine confidence is unknown.\n\nThe Internet and Social Media  Approximately 90% of Americans \nand  91%  of  Canadians  use  the  Internet,  and  80%  of  Americans  and \n60%  of  Canadians  have  a  social  network  profile.  Widespread  access \nto  social  media  can  be  empowering,  but  it  is  also  problematic.  The \nInternet  and  social  media  require  users  to  select  their  information \nsources,  creating  an  environment  described  as  an  \u201cecho  chamber\u201d  in \nwhich  individuals  choose  information  sources  harboring  beliefs  or \nopinions  similar  to  their  own  and  thereby  reinforcing  their  existing \nviews. This situation has created a new platform for further spread of \nvaccine misinformation (inaccuracies due to error) and disinformation \n(deliberate lies) and has provided a forum for vaccine-resistant individ-\nuals, including celebrities, to organize and raise funds to support their \nefforts. The harmful effects of Internet and social media use on vaccine \nhesitancy have been well documented. Vaccine hesitancy increases for \nparents who seek their information from the Internet. Unfortunately, \npublic health and health care institutions have been slow to adapt to \nthis new communication medium and to recognize its influence and \nimpact. In this medium, personal stories and anecdotes are now viewed \nas  data  and  disproportionately  influence  vaccine  decision-making, \nwhile  traditional,  more  authoritative,  fact-based  information  sources \nare  deemphasized.  Centralized  monitoring  by  jurisdiction  of  vaccine \nmisinformation  and  disinformation,  with  summaries  of  the  relevant \ndiscourses  and  rebuttals  provided  to  HCPs,  has  been  proposed  as  a \npotential way to counter the influence of social media on vaccine hes-\nitancy. While such strategies have been applied in single jurisdictions \nand appear to have had some success, their applicability to a broader \ncontext  is  unknown.  Moreover,  the  resources  for  such  a  coordinated \nresponse have not been made available, and individual HCPs have been \nleft to counter popular, shifting, viral communications on their own, \npatient by patient.\n\nAs  with  traditional  media,  the  social  media  landscape  appears  to \nbe shifting. In 2019, the proliferation of anti-vaccination information \ncombined  with  measles  outbreaks  in  North  America  and  increasing \npressure from health leaders led large social media companies (Face-\nbook, Instagram, Pinterest) to deemphasize anti-vaccination informa-\ntion by removing relevant advertisements and recommendations and \ndecreasing their prominence in search results. While it is too soon to \ndetermine the effects of these measures, critics are skeptical that they \nwill have the intended result of reducing vaccine misinformation and \ndisinformation.  Early  evidence  shows  that  misleading  content  is  still \nwidely available, with anti-vaccine advertisements now using the term \n\u201cvaccine choice\u201d to avoid censorship. More disturbingly, public health \nadvertisements in support of vaccination have been included in social \nbans and removed from social media sites.\n\nIn a more grassroots effort, providers and vaccine supporters have \nunited on social media to provide online support and evidence-based \nfacts  to  providers  and  others  who  support  vaccines  when  they  are \nattacked digitally by anti-vaccine supporters. For example, Shots Heard \nRound  the  World  (www.shotsheard.com)  is  an  effort  led  by  two  U.S. \npediatricians to provide advice and support for HCPs who speak out \nabout  the  importance  of  vaccines.  Such  efforts  harness  the  power  of \nsocial media in ways similar to those used by vaccine opponents and \nmay prove successful in combating vaccine hesitancy.\n\nGiven these social and cultural trends, no one should be surprised \nwhen individuals now question vaccination, express confusion about \nconflicting  information  and  information  sources,  and  feel  unsure \nwhom to trust. Their broader social context is telling them they should \nquestion  everything  and  trust  no  one.  This  message  is  reinforced  via \nmisinformation  and  disinformation  on  social  media.  Recent  vaccine- \npreventable  disease  outbreaks  illustrate  that  effective  engagement \nwith individuals cannot be accomplished through one-way, top-down \ninformation provision (which still is often the de facto choice for health \nsystem communication), but rather requires a dialogue that takes into \naccount the social processes surrounding individual vaccination deci-\nsions. It is at the interface between the individual and the health system \nin which conversations between HCPs and their patients can have the \ngreatest impact. It is critical for all HCPs to discuss vaccines and pro-\nvide  strong  vaccine  recommendations\u2014including  HCPs  who  do  not \nadminister vaccines but who have established trust with their patients.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   16\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

On  a  programmatic  level,  vaccine-hesitancy  interventions \nshould be multicomponent, dialogue based, and tailored to specific \nunder-vaccinated populations.\n\nCommunicating  with  vaccine-hesitant  individuals  can  be  chal-\nlenging and time-consuming. HCPs may feel that vaccine-hesitant \npatients  cast  doubt  on  their  personal  and  professional  integrity, \ntheir  authority  as  medical  experts,  and  their  competence  as  com-\nmunicators. Some HCPs may be reluctant to initiate conversations \nabout  vaccination  because  of  concerns  that  discussing  a  sensitive \ntopic  may  compromise  their  clinical  rapport  with  their  patients. \nOther  HCPs  may  believe  that  they  have  not  received  sufficient \ntraining to confidently recommend vaccines and answer questions. \nDiscussing  vaccines  with  hesitant  patients,  while  not  always  easy, \nprovides an opportunity to honor the principles of patient-centered \ncare  by  demonstrating  an  interest  in  patients\u2019  opinions,  engaging \nin dialogue, and ideally increasing patients\u2019 confidence in vaccine \nrecommendations. \nFACTORS IN EFFECTIVE VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS\nVaccine recommendations ideally should be made within an estab-\nlished,  trusting  patient\u2013provider  relationship  in  which  patients  are \ncomfortable  asking  questions  and  voicing  concerns,  even  if  their \nviews  on  vaccines  contradict  the  HCP\u2019s  recommendations.  Rec-\nommending  vaccines  requires  both  provision  of  information  and \neffective  communication.  There  is  no  single  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  for \nhow providers should approach recommending vaccines to vaccine- \nhesitant  individuals.  In  general,  all  vaccine  recommendations \nshould be (1) strong, making it clear that the provider supports and \nrecommends vaccination; (2) tailored, acknowledging the vaccine \nattitudes  and  potential  concerns  of  individual  patients;  (3)  trans-\nparent and accurate, highlighting the benefits of vaccines while also \ncommunicating  the  risks;  (4)  supported  by  trustworthy  informa-\ntion resources that patients can access and review after the clinical \nencounter;  and  (5)  revisited,  with  repetition  and  reinforcement \nduring follow-up health care encounters. \nStrength  of  the  Recommendation  HCPs  should  make  it  explicit \n(in  the  absence  of  medical  contraindications)  that  vaccination \nbased  on  the  recommended  schedule  is  the  best  option.  While \nHCPs  should  take  time  to  elicit  patients\u2019  questions  and  address \nconcerns, the recommendation for vaccination should be made in \nclear and unambiguous terms. \nTailored  Communication  Vaccine  hesitancy  occurs  on  a  contin-\nuum (Fig. 3-1). Therefore, it is helpful for HCPs to have some under-\nstanding of their patients\u2019 attitudes toward vaccination at the start of \nthe health care appointment. Unfortunately, vaccine-hesitancy sur-\nveys for use as part of vaccine consultation visits have not been val-\nidated on a large scale. However, the following are some examples \nof questions that can be asked, depending on the setting. (1) Did \nyou have a chance to review the vaccine leaflet we provided? Did \nyou have any questions about it? (2) Have you ever been reluctant \nor hesitant about getting a vaccination for yourself or your child? If \nso, what were the reasons? (3) Are there other pressures in your life \nthat prevent you from getting yourself or your child immunized on \ntime? (4) Whom/what resources do you trust the most for informa-\ntion about vaccines? Whom/what resources do you trust the least?\nCommunication  style  and  content  for  patients  in  the  active- \ndemand  category  for  vaccination  will  be  different  from  those  for \nindividuals who are hesitant, late and selective, or strongly inclined \nto refuse vaccines. Two communication styles have been proposed \nfor vaccine recommendations. Evidence shows that a presumptive/\ndirective  approach  (\u201cYour  child  is  due  for  MMR  vaccination.\u201d) \nresults in higher rates of vaccine uptake than a participatory/guiding \napproach  (\u201cWhat  are  your  thoughts  about  the  MMR  vaccine?\u201d). \n\nHowever,  adopting  a  strictly  presumptive/directive  approach  may \nalienate some patients, especially those who are higher up on the \nhesitancy  pyramid  and  who  may  feel  that  they  are  being  pres-\nsured  into  vaccination  before  their  concerns  have  been  heard \nand  addressed.  Adopting  a  participatory/guiding  approach  and \nclarifying receptivity to vaccines may be more suitable for hesitant \nindividuals  with  many  doubts  and  concerns,  persons  with  a  late \nor selective attitude, and those who are strongly inclined to refuse \nvaccines.  In  addition,  a  participatory/guiding  approach  provides \nan opportunity for ongoing clinical rapport and dialogue between \nunvaccinated  or  under-vaccinated  patients  and  their  HCPs,  even \nwhen it does not result in immediate vaccine uptake. Regardless of \nwhich approach is used, a strong vaccine recommendation should \nbe made at each encounter. \n\nTransparency  and  Accuracy  Vaccine  recommendations  should \nbe  transparent,  should  include  accurate  information  about  both \nthe  benefits  and  the  risks  of  the  vaccine,  and  should  emphasize \nwhy  the  benefits  outweigh  the  risks.  For  example,  when  evidence \nsupports  an  association  between  a  vaccine  and  an  adverse  event, \nthe occurrence of the adverse event is often very rare and the event \nquickly resolves (Chap. 123). U.S. Federal law (under the National \nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act) requires HCPs to provide a copy of \nthe  current  Vaccine  Information  Statement  from  the  Centers  for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), which describes both ben-\nefits and risks of vaccines to an adult patient or to a child\u2019s parent/\nlegal representative before vaccination.\n\nCDC Vaccine Information Statements should not replace a dis-\ncussion with the HCP. Depending on the provider and the patient, \na description of benefits and risks may include words and numbers, \ngraphics, and personal anecdotes (e.g., why the provider vaccinates \nhis  or  her  own  children).  Personal  anecdotes  are  powerful,  and \nmany hesitant patients seek and are influenced by them.\n\nA  discussion  of  benefits  and  risks  provides  an  opportunity  to \naddress specific misconceptions about a particular vaccine or about \nvaccines  overall.  For  example,  patients  may  be  concerned  about \nadverse events following vaccination that are not supported by evi-\ndence,  such  as  autism  following  MMR  vaccination  or  myocardial \ninfarction following influenza vaccination in the elderly.\n\nMost adults\u2014even those whose children are fully immunized\u2014\nstill  have  questions,  misconceptions,  or  concerns  about  vaccines \nthat  should  be  addressed.  A  risk/benefit  discussion  allows  HCPs \nto  describe  the  vaccine  safety  monitoring  systems  in  place.  Pro-\nviders should emphasize that vaccines are developed and approved \nthrough a highly regulated process that includes prelicensure clini-\ncal trials, review and approval by designated regulatory authorities \n(e.g.,  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration,  Health  Canada), \nstrict manufacturing regulations, and ongoing postmarketing safety \nsurveillance. \n\nSupport from Accessible Information Sources  All vaccine recom-\nmendations should be supported by additional information sources \npatients  can  assess  after  the  health  care  encounter.  HCPs  play  an \nimportant  role  as  information  intermediaries  for  their  patients. \nThey  can  navigate  information  (and  misinformation)  about  vac-\ncines  and  direct  patients  toward  reliable,  appropriate  resources. \nHCPs should consider what resources will be suitable for a patient \nor patient population. Vaccine information resources are available \nin  different  media  formats  and  use  a  combination  of  images  and \ntext  to  communicate  the  information  to  various  audiences.  See \n\u201cFurther Reading,\u201d below, for suggestions or refer to resources pro-\nvided by local health authorities. \n\nRevisiting and Reinforcement of Vaccine Recommendations  All \nhealth care encounters offer an opportunity to revisit and reinforce \nvaccine  recommendations.  Vaccine-hesitant  individuals  who  do \nnot  accept  vaccines  but  are  willing  to  review  information  should \nbe  offered  a  follow-up  appointment  to  reinforce  previously  made \nrecommendations and address further questions. Vaccine-hesitant \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   17\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

Patients  who  actively  demand  vaccines  usually  do \nnot require much follow-up other than to confirm and document \nthe receipt of vaccine (if it is not given at the point of care) and to \naddress additional questions or concerns arising subsequent to vac-\ncination. Often this follow-up can be covered without an office visit. \nWHAT TO SAY TO VACCINE-HESITANT PATIENTS\nEngaging vaccine-hesitant individuals requires confidence, knowl-\nedge,  skills,  time,  and  creativity  to  tailor  the  approach  to  each \nindividual  patient.  Examples  for  each  part  of  the  vaccine  recom-\nmendation are listed in Table 3-2.\n\n \u25a0 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS DURING CLINICAL \nENCOUNTERS\nMissed  Opportunities  The  World  Health  Organization  defines \na  missed  opportunity  for  vaccination  as  \u201cany  contact  with  health \nservices by an individual (child or person of any age) who is eligible \n\nfor vaccination (e.g., unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and free of \ncontraindications to vaccination), which does not result in the person \nreceiving one or more of the vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible.\u201d \nHCPs who do not offer point-of-care vaccination frequently miss the \nopportunity to recommend vaccines to their patients. Missed opportu-\nnities for recommending and providing vaccines during routine health \ncare encounters contribute to under-vaccination. Studies show that up \nto 45% of under-vaccinated children could be up to date with all age- \nappropriate vaccines and up to 90% of female adolescents could be up \nto date with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination if all opportu-\nnities to vaccinate were taken.\n\nVaccine  counseling  and  vaccination  should  be  incorporated  into \nclinical care for individuals of all ages, not just young children. Because \nmany adolescents and adults do not have regular health care follow-up, \nproviders  need  to  take  advantage  of  every  health  care  encounter  to \nrecommend and provide vaccines. For example, a visit to an emergency \ndepartment,  a  routine  follow-up  visit  at  a  diabetes  clinic,  or  a  visit \nplanning for elective orthopedic surgery offer opportunities to inquire \nabout the patient\u2019s vaccination status and to recommend vaccines.\n\nHCPs  should  make  preemptive  vaccine  recommendations  (e.g.,  ini-\ntiating  discussions  about  infant  vaccines  during  pregnancy,  inform-\ning  parents  about  HPV  vaccine  before  their  child  becomes  eligible). \nSuch  advance  discussions  may  be  especially  helpful  in  identifying  \n\nTABLE 3-2  Sample Vaccine Conversations\nSTRONG VACCINE RECOMMENDATION\n\u201cWe are headed into the flu season. Getting flu vaccine not only protects you, but it helps protect other people around you who can get very sick from flu. I strongly \nrecommend you get your flu shot. Do you know where to get it?\u201d\n\u201cYou will be turning 50 next year. This means you will be eligible for a vaccine that prevents shingles, and I strongly recommend you receive it. Have you heard about \nthis vaccine before? Can I answer your questions about it?\u201d\n\u201cI know you are not comfortable getting vaccinated today. I do want to make it clear that I recommend vaccines because I am convinced they are the best way to \nprotect you from some serious diseases. Is there something that would lead you to think about getting vaccinated in the future?\u201d\n\nTAILORED COMMUNICATION\n\u201cI recommend that children and adults stay up to date on recommended vaccines. I see from your vaccine record that you\u2019ve had your childhood vaccines, but \nyou haven\u2019t gotten any adult vaccines. I wanted to clarify whether this is because you decided not to get vaccines or something else prevented you from getting \nvaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that you are here for your pneumococcal vaccine. This is the best way to protect yourself and those around you from pneumonia. Do you have any \nquestions before I give you the vaccine?\u201d\n\u201cI understand you have some concerns about vaccines. What are you most concerned about? Would you like me to explain why I recommend giving your child these \nvaccines?\u201d\n\nTRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY\n\u201cSerious side effects can develop after MMR vaccination but are very rare. On average, 3 out of 10,000 children who get MMR vaccine will have a febrile seizure/\nconvulsion in the days after vaccination. Febrile seizures can be frightening, but nearly all children who have a febrile seizure recover very quickly and without any \nlong-term consequences. On the other hand, 1 out of 1000 children who get measles will develop encephalitis (brain inflammation) that not only causes seizures but can \nalso lead to permanent damage.\u201d\n\u201cAbout 10 out of every 10,000 Americans who do not get vaccinated against flu die because of influenza every year, and many more are hospitalized. While flu vaccine \ndoes not prevent all cases of influenza, it is the most effective vaccine we have. By getting the vaccine, you also help protect people around you from getting sick.\u201d\n\u201cYou are correct, aluminum is used in some vaccines to help the body\u2019s immune system respond. However, aluminum is also present in food and drinking water. In fact, \nthe amount of aluminum present in vaccines is similar to or less than what is present in breast milk or infant formulas.\u201d\n\nSUPPORT FROM ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION SOURCES\n\u201cYour child and other boys and girls his age will be eligible for the human papillomavirus vaccine this coming school year. Have you heard about this vaccine before? \nWhat questions do you have about it? Here\u2019s a list of websites for parents and teenagers that explain what it is about.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information about vaccines on the internet, and a lot of that information is not based on facts. Here is a list of websites that have been reviewed by \nhealth care professionals and accurately describe benefits and risks of each vaccine. The information is written in lay language and includes helpful illustrations.\u201d\n\nREVISITING AND REINFORCEMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATION\n\u201cDuring our last visit, we talked about MMR vaccine for your son and some of the concerns you had about potential side effects. Have you had a chance to look at the \ntake-home information I gave you? Was there anything else you would like to ask about? I recommend that we vaccinate your child today.\u201d\n\u201cDuring our last visit, we talked about receiving a pertussis booster during pregnancy and where you can get vaccinated. Have you had a chance to get your pertussis \nvaccine?\u201d\n \u201cI see that you got your vaccines at the public health clinic last week. How did it go? Did you have any questions?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the symptoms you experienced after receiving the vaccine were an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I will report this to the health authority. Let\u2019s \ndiscuss what we can do next time to prevent symptoms from occurring again.\u201d\n\nNote: Specific vaccine recommendations, vaccine eligibility guidelines, and statistics used to communicate benefits and risks will vary with the health jurisdiction \nand the country. Several sample statements here are adapted from the Australian National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance website (www.\ntalkingaboutimmunisation.org.au).

Providers who recommend vaccines but do not vaccinate \nat  the  point  of  care  should  inform  patients  where  they  can  be  vacci-\nnated.  This  discussion  may  include  information  about  public  health \nclinics, travel clinics, and pharmacies or a referral to another provider. \nHCPs should follow up with their patients at subsequent appointments \nto confirm that they were vaccinated.\n\nAdverse Events Following Vaccination  Although rare, adverse \nevents (Chap. 123) may influence vaccine acceptance and willingness \nto  be  vaccinated  in  the  future.  It  is  important  for  providers  to  iden-\ntify and follow up with all patients who experience an adverse event, \nregardless of the patients\u2019 vaccine attitudes prior to the event. Adverse \nevents following vaccination should be reported to the relevant vaccine \nmonitoring system: the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \nor the Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance \nSystem.\n\nAddressing  Inequities  In  Vaccine  Access  Discrepancies  in \naccess  to  health  care  services  create  inequitable  access  to  vaccines \nfor  children  and  adults  and  contribute  to  under-vaccination.  A  U.S. \nstudy  found  that  socially  disadvantaged  individuals  were  more  likely \nthan  other  persons  to  be  under-vaccinated,  in  part  because  of  a  lack \nof  access  to  health  care  services.  HCPs  must  recognize  that  socially \ndisadvantaged individuals and populations are often at greater risk of \nvaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., as a result of crowded living condi-\ntions, limited access to sanitation, poor nutrition, or substance abuse) \nand  also  at  greater  risk  of  being  under-vaccinated  because  they  have \nlimited access to health care services. In addition, specific vaccines may \nbe recommended for some socially disadvantaged populations or com-\nmunities. For example, in the wake of several outbreaks of hepatitis A \namong the U.S. homeless population, the CDC now recommends that \neveryone >1 year of age experiencing homelessness receive hepatitis A \nvaccine.\n\nDepending on the setting and the patient, some recommended vac-\ncines may not be covered through public funding or private insurance \ncoverage. HCPs should be aware of alternative funding models, such \nas  the  Vaccines  for  Children  Program,  which  provides  free  vaccines \nfor U.S. children (<19 years of age) with financial barriers to vaccine \naccess.  When  vaccines  are  not  publicly  funded  or  covered  by  private \ninsurance  and  patients  perceive  that  they  cannot  afford  a  vaccine, \nHCPs should not withhold a vaccine recommendation. The risks and \nbenefits  of  vaccination  still  need  to  be  communicated,  with  a  strong \nrecommendation, and the patient should be provided the opportunity \nto decide whether they can afford the vaccine.\n\nFurther Communication With Patients Who Refuse Vaccines  \nFortunately,  the  proportion  of  people  who  completely  refuse  all  vac-\ncines and are not willing to talk to their HCP is small. Nevertheless, in \nsome cases, attempts to initiate discussion and address vaccine refusal \nmay  be  futile.  When  possible,  HCPs  should  focus  on  the  common \ngoals of care and preserve the therapeutic relationship. Vaccine refusal \nshould be well documented in the patient\u2019s chart. The HCP should con-\ntinue with tailored communication and be open to future discussions. \nVaccine  demand  and  vaccine  refusal  are  rarely  static  over  time.  (See \n\u201cFocus: COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,\u201d below.)\n \u25a0 CONCLUSION\nIn  summary,  vaccine  hesitancy  is  complex  and  context  specific.  It \nvaries with time, place, patient, and vaccine. HCPs are well positioned \nto address vaccine hesitancy and should develop the skills, knowledge, \nand  confidence  to  make  strong  vaccine  recommendations  to  their \npatients.\n \u25a0 FOCUS: COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY\nAs COVID-19 vaccines are used to control SARS-CoV-2, some indi-\nviduals will have concerns about these vaccines and a proportion of \n\nthe  population  will  reject  them.  While  worrisome,  hesitancy  about \nCOVID-19  vaccines  is  not  unexpected;  it  mirrors  public  concerns \nexpressed  about  past  pandemic  influenza  vaccines  and  other  newly \nintroduced  vaccines.  It  has  been  established  that  the  newness  of \nany  vaccine,  be  it  a  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  or  a  COVID-19 \nvaccine, raises concern in a large percentage of the population. Polit-\nicization  of  COVID-19  vaccines  raises  additional  issues  for  some  \npatients.\n\nPast Experience with New Vaccines  Past experience with new \nvaccines, including the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009 and \nthe human papillomavirus vaccine in the early 2000s, provides a guide \nto topics that need to be addressed with regard to COVID-19 vaccines. \nWhile resistance is often framed as uncertainty about a vaccine\u2019s \u201cnew-\nness,\u201d further discussion translates this uncertainty into concern about \nthe  new  vaccine\u2019s  safety.  This  concern  encompasses  both  short-  and \nlong-term side effects. Frequent, acute adverse effects can be captured \nin  clinical  trial  data,  whereas  worries  about  rare  and  long-term  side \neffects can be addressed only by direct evidence after the initiation of \na  new  vaccination  program.  In  addition  to  queries  about  the  overall \nsafety of the vaccine, HCPs can expect specific questions regarding the \nsafety of individual ingredients included in the vaccine, whether or not \nthese ingredients are new and whether or not relevant safety data are \navailable. Information on the incidence of common or expected health \nevents  in  an  unvaccinated  population  (i.e.,  background  rates)  over  a \n4-week period is helpful in distinguishing what is normal and expected \nfrom  a  point  of  concern.  Studies  that  have  examined  this  issue  with \nregard  to  other  vaccines  can  be  used  as  a  basis  for  presenting  back-\nground rates of expected events in the context of COVID-19 vaccines \nfor some groups; however, it is important to ensure that more specific \nbackground-rate information is available to HCPs with regard to the \nindividual  groups  being  vaccinated.  HCPs,  public  health  programs, \nand vaccine manufacturers can anticipate these questions and should \ndevelop answers and information to respond to them.\n\nSpecific  Concerns  about  COVID-19  Vaccines  While  some \nconcerns can be anticipated on the basis of past experience with new \nvaccines,  several  characteristics  of  COVID-19  vaccines  require  new \napproaches to adequately address individual concerns, and HCPs need \nto  educate  themselves  in  several  specific  areas.  First,  an  overwhelm-\ning  amount  of  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  speed  of  development \nof  COVID-19  vaccines,  with  some  jurisdictions  even  skipping  the \nusual  clinical-trial  steps  in  an  effort  to  provide  vaccine  more  rapidly \nto their populations. This situation directly increases concerns about \nthe  \u201cnewness\u201d  of  the  vaccine  and  its  safety  and,  unfortunately,  raises \nquestions about the entire vaccine development process. Education is \nrequired  to  explain  how  a  process  that  normally  requires  5\u201310  years \nwas  condensed  to  this  degree.  (See  Lurie  et  al  [2020]  for  an  excel-\nlent  explanation  of  the  COVID-19  vaccine  development  process.)  In \naddition, transparency with regard to clinical trial data is required to \nenable  scientists,  HCPs,  and  consumers  to  read  and  understand  the \ndevelopment and evaluation processes. The usually shrouded, propri-\netary development process is unsuitable if the final vaccine product is \nto garner public trust. Education on existing vaccine-safety monitoring \nsystems also needs to be provided. HCPs must familiarize themselves \nwith the vaccine development process and safety monitoring systems if \nthey are to present this information to their patients.\n\nSecond,  several  newer  vaccine  platforms  that  are  being  used  for \nCOVID-19  vaccines  (e.g.,  nucleic  acid\u2013based  vaccines,  viral  vector) \nhave not been used in the past. This novelty exacerbates public con-\ncern  about  the  unfamiliarity  of  new  vaccines  and  further  heightens \nmisgivings about vaccine safety and the potential for long-term adverse \neffects. Again, HCPs need to familiarize themselves with the new tech-\nnology and develop effective messaging for their patients. Public health \nofficials have developed resources to address this issue (see www.cdc.\ngov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence.html), but, even in the \nabsence  of  such  resources,  HCPs  can  anticipate  questions  about  the \nnew technology involved and become comfortable explaining it.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   19\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n"

For example, long-\nterm-care  residents  were  prioritized  for  vaccine  receipt,  but  clinical \ntrial data were not available for the range of chronic health conditions \nthat exist in older adults. While observational studies have filled some \nof these gaps, HCPs need to extrapolate on the basis of available evi-\ndence in considering individual patients and must make a recommen-\ndation without knowing all the answers.\n\nFourth,  some  minority  and  marginalized  communities  who  have \nbeen  disproportionately  affected  by  COVID-19  express  hesitancy  or \nreject  COVID-19  vaccines.  For  some  Black,  Indigenous,  Latinx,  and \nother  communities,  COVID-19  hesitancy  stems  directly  from  sys-\ntematic  discrimination,  racism,  and  mistreatment  in  the  health  care \nsystem. Black and Indigenous communities also share a horrific legacy \nof  unethical  medical  experimentation,1  which,  when  combined  with \ncurrent discrimination and overt racism, creates a powerful climate of \nmistrust in HCPs, the medical system, and science.\n\nSocial  and  Cultural  Trends  The  social  and  cultural  trends \nalready  discussed  in  this  chapter\u2014in  particular,  traditional  media, \nthe  Internet,  and  social  media\u2014are  exerting  influence  and  pressure \nthat did not affect the introduction of older vaccines, even the H1N1 \npandemic vaccines. The media attention given to the development of \ntransverse myelitis in one clinical-trial participant following receipt of \nCOVID-19 vaccine is but one example of the intense media scrutiny \nof  the  vaccine  development  process.  Unfortunately,  in  the  United \nStates,  efforts  to  control  COVID-19,  including  vaccine  development, \nhave  become  highly  politicized.  This  degree  of  politicization  has  not \noccurred  with  past  vaccines,  so  HCPs  are  in  uncharted  territory  in \nterms of how to address it or even to understand its potential influence \non vaccine acceptance. Again, individual HCPs need to navigate com-\nplex conversations with their patients and possibly their communities. \nBelow  are  some  suggestions  that  may  prove  helpful  in  formulating \nthese conversations.\n\nTips  for  Discussion  of  COVID-19  Vaccines \n\u2022\u2003 ADDRESS \nCONCERNS  ABOUT  \u201cNEWNESS\u201d  HCPs  need  to  understand  and  be \nable to explain the newer vaccine platforms (mRNA, DNA, and viral \nvector vaccines) and to provide examples of other, older vaccines that \nhave  been  developed  by  similar  techniques.  This  information  makes \nCOVID-19 vaccines more familiar.\nADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY  HCPs need to under-\nstand  and  explain  how  vaccines  are  evaluated  before  being  approved \nfor use and how vaccine safety is monitored after vaccines are used in \nthe population. It is important to be honest and state that potential rare \nand long-term effects are not yet known, but then to speak to what is \nfrom the animal and clinical trial data and to comment on background \nrates for rare events. Placing potential vaccine risks in the context of \nknown COVID-19 disease risks is helpful for some patients.\n\nDepending  on  the  context,  explain  why  specific  high-risk  groups \nmay  have  been  prioritized  to  receive  the  vaccine.  Patients  who  have \nbeen prioritized may still need a strong recommendation from an HCP \nto accept the vaccine. An HCP recommendation is as important here \nas it is for acceptance of routine vaccines. As with other vaccines, many \npatients\u2019  decision  to  accept  a  COVID-19  vaccine  rests  upon  whether \ntheir HCP recommends it.\n\n1The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is the most infamous example of medical exper-\nimentation  in  Black  communities  in  the  United  States.  (See  Brandt  [1978] \nfor  details.)  Numerous  examples  of  medical  experimentation  on  Indigenous \npeoples  are  available.  For  example,  a  12-year  trial  of  an  experimental  bacille \nCalmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine for tuberculosis was conducted on Cree and Nakoda \nOyadebi infants in Saskatchewan during the 1930s. (See Lux [2016] for details.)\n\nAddress  implicit  or  overt  racism  and  systemic  discrimination  in  the \nmedical  system  and  create  culturally  safe  health  care  spaces.  HCPs \nneed  to  be  aware  of  the  legacy  of  discrimination,  racism,  and  medi-\ncal experimentation and the distrust it fosters in some communities. \nWhile  SARS-CoV-2  has  critically  highlighted  fractures  in  our  health \ncare  system  for  minority  and  marginalized  communities,  addressing \nthese underlying issues goes beyond addressing vaccine hesitancy and \nis clearly needed for all types of medical care in these communities.\n\nEMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING UP TO DATE WITH OTHER \nROUTINE  VACCINES  DURING  THE  COVID-19  PANDEMIC  These  vac-\ncines include but are not limited to seasonal influenza vaccine and the \nchildhood primary vaccination series.\n\n \u25a0 FURTHER READING\nVaccine Hesitancy\nAmerican  Academy  of  Pediatrics:  Vaccine  hesitant  parents. \nAvailable  at  www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health- \ninitiatives/immunizations/Pages/vaccine-hesitant-parents.aspx. \nAccessed October 23, 2020.\n\nDeStefano  F  et  al:  Principal  controversies  in  vaccine  safety  in  the \n\nUnited States.

    "text": "4 Decision-Making in  \nClinical Medicine\nDaniel B. Mark, John B. Wong\n\nPracticing medicine at its core requires making decisions. What makes \nmedical  practice  so  difficult  is  not  only  the  specialized  technical \nknowledge required but also the intrinsic uncertainty that surrounds \neach  decision.  Mastering  the  technical  aspects  of  medicine  alone, \nunfortunately, does not ensure a mastery of the practice of medicine. \nSir William Osler\u2019s familiar quote \u201cMedicine is a science of uncertainty \nand an art of probability\u201d captures well this complex duality. Although \nthe  science  of  medicine  is  often  taught  as  if  the  mechanisms  of  the \nhuman  body  operate  with  Newtonian  predictability,  every  aspect  of \nmedical practice is infused with an element of irreducible uncertainty \nthat  the  clinician  ignores  at  her  peril.  Although  deeply  rooted  in \nscience,  more  than  100  years  after  the  practice  of  medicine  took  its \nmodern form, it remains at its core a craft, to which individual doctors \nbring varying levels of skill and understanding. With the exponential \ngrowth  in  medical  literature  and  other  technical  information  and  an \never-increasing number of testing and treatment options, twenty-first \ncentury  physicians  who  seek  excellence  in  their  craft  must  master  a \nmore diverse and complex set of skills than any of the generations that \npreceded them. This chapter provides an introduction to three of the \npillars upon which the craft of modern medicine rests: (1) expertise in \nclinical reasoning (what it is and how it can be developed); (2) rational \ndiagnostic test use and interpretation; and (3) integration of the best \navailable research evidence with clinical judgment in the care of indi-\nvidual patients (evidence-based medicine [EBM]).\n\n \u25a0 BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL REASONING\nClinical  Expertise  Defining  \u201cclinical  expertise\u201d  remains  surpris-\ningly  difficult.  Chess  has  an  objective  ranking  system  based  on  skill \nand  performance  criteria.  Athletics,  similarly,  have  ranking  systems \nto  distinguish  novices  from  Olympians.  But  in  medicine,  after  phy-\nsicians complete training and pass the boards (or get recertified), no \ntests or benchmarks are used to identify those who have attained the \nhighest  levels  of  clinical  performance.  At  each  institution,  there  are \noften a few \u201celite\u201d clinicians who are known for their \u201cspecial problem- \nsolving prowess\u201d when particularly difficult or obscure cases have baf-\nfled everyone else. Yet despite their skill, even such master clinicians \ntypically  cannot  explain  their  exact  processes  and  methods,  thereby \nlimiting  the  acquisition  and  dissemination  of  the  expertise  used \nto  achieve  their  impressive  results.  Furthermore,  clinical  virtuosity \nappears not to be generalizable, e.g., an expert on hypertrophic cardio-\nmyopathy may be no better (and possibly worse) than a first-year med-\nical resident at diagnosing and managing a patient with neutropenia, \nfever, and hypotension.\n\nBroadly construed, clinical expertise encompasses not only cogni-\ntive  dimensions  involving  the  integration  of  disease  knowledge  with \nverbal and visual cues and test interpretation but also potentially the \ncomplex fine-motor skills necessary for invasive procedures and tests. \nIn addition, \u201cthe complete package\u201d of expertise in medicine requires \neffective  communication  and  care  coordination  with  patients  and \nmembers of the medical team. Research on medical expertise remains \nsparse  overall  and  mostly  centered  on  diagnostic  reasoning,  so  in \nthis chapter, we focus primarily on the cognitive elements of clinical \nreasoning.\n\nBecause clinical reasoning occurs in the heads of clinicians, objec-\ntive  study  of  the  process  is  difficult.  One  research  method  used  for \nthis area asks clinicians to \u201cthink out loud\u201d as they receive increments \nof  clinical  information  in  a  manner  meant  to  simulate  a  clinical \nencounter. Another research approach focuses on how doctors should \nreason  diagnostically,  to  identify  remediable  \u201cerrors,\u201d  rather  than  on \nhow  they  actually  do  reason.  Much  of  what  is  known  about  clinical \n\n21\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n4\n\nD\ne\nc\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\n-\nM\na\nk\ni\nn\ng\ni\nn\nC\n\nl\ni\nn\ni\nc\na\nl\n\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\ni\nn\ne\n\nreasoning  comes  from  empirical  studies  of  nonmedical  problem- \nsolving  behavior.  Because  of  the  diverse  perspectives  contributing  to \nthis  area,  with  important  contributions  from  cognitive  psychology, \nmedical education, behavioral economics, sociology, informatics, and \ndecision  sciences,  no  single  integrated  model  of  clinical  reasoning \nexists,  and  not  infrequently,  different  terms  and  reasoning  models \ndescribe similar phenomena.\n\nIntuitive  Versus  Analytic  Reasoning  A  useful  contemporary \nmodel of reasoning, the dual-process theory distinguishes two general \nconceptual  modes  of  thinking  as  fast  or  slow.  Intuition  (System  1)  \nprovides  rapid  effortless  judgments  from  memorized  associations \nusing pattern recognition and other simplifying \u201crules of thumb\u201d (i.e., \nheuristics).  For  example,  a  very  simple  pattern  that  could  be  useful \nin  certain  situations  is  \u201cblack  woman  plus  hilar  adenopathy  equals \nsarcoid.\u201d  Because  no  effort  is  involved  in  recalling  the  pattern,  the \nclinician is often unable to say how those judgments were formulated. \nIn  contrast,  Analysis  (System  2),  the  other  form  of  reasoning  in  the \ndual-process model, is slow, methodical, deliberative, and effortful. A \nstudent might read about causes of hilar adenopathy and from that list \n(e.g.,  Chap.  66),  identify  diseases  more  common  in  black  women  or \nexamine the patient for skin or eye findings that occur with sarcoid. \nThese dual processes, of course, represent two exemplars taken from \nthe cognitive continuum. They provide helpful descriptive insights but \nvery little guidance in how to develop expertise in clinical reasoning. \nHow  these  idealized  systems  interact  in  different  decision  problems, \nhow experts use them differently from novices, and when their use can \nlead to errors in judgment remain the subject of study and considerable \ndebate.\n\nPattern  recognition,  an  important  part  of  System  1  reasoning,  is \na  complex  cognitive  process  that  appears  largely  effortless.  One  can \nrecognize people\u2019s faces, the breed of a dog, an automobile model, or \na  piece  of  music  from  just  a  few  notes  within  milliseconds  without \nnecessarily being able to articulate the specific features that prompted \nthe  recognition.  Analogously,  experienced  clinicians  often  recognize \nfamiliar diagnostic patterns very quickly. The key here is having a large \nlibrary of stored patterns that can be rapidly accessed. In the absence \nof  an  extensive  stored  repertoire  of  diagnostic  patterns,  students  (as \nwell as experienced clinicians operating outside their area of expertise \nand familiarity) often must use the more laborious System 2 analytic \napproach along with more intensive and comprehensive data collection \nto reach the diagnosis.\n\nThe  following  brief  patient  scenarios  illustrate  three  distinct  pat-\nterns associated with hemoptysis that experienced clinicians recognize \nwithout effort:\n\n\u2022\u2003 A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint \nof  hemoptysis.  An  otherwise  healthy,  nonsmoker,  he  is  recovering \nfrom an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests \nthat  the  small  amount  of  blood-streaked  sputum  is  due  to  acute \nbronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that \na more serious disorder is absent.\n\n\u2022\u2003 In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief \ncomplaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive \nmorning  cough  with  blood-streaked  sputum,  and  weight  loss  fits \nthe pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the \nchest x-ray, the clinician obtains a sputum cytology examination and \nrefers this patient for a chest CT scan.\n\n\u2022\u2003 In  the  third  scenario,  the  clinician  hears  a  soft  diastolic  rumbling \nmurmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation in a 46-year-old patient \nwith  hemoptysis  who  immigrated  from  a  developing  country  and \norders  an  echocardiogram  as  well,  because  of  possible  pulmonary \nhypertension from suspected rheumatic mitral stenosis.\n\nPattern  recognition  by  itself  is  not,  however,  sufficient  for  secure \ndiagnosis.  Without  deliberative  systematic  reflection,  undisciplined \npattern recognition can result in premature closure: mistakenly jump-\ning to the conclusion that one has the correct diagnosis before all the \nrelevant  data  are  in.  A  critical  second  step,  therefore,  even  when  the \ndiagnosis seems obvious, is diagnostic verification: considering whether \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   21\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n"

    "text": "22\n\nthe  diagnosis  adequately  accounts  for  the  presenting  symptoms  and \nsigns  and  can  explain  all  the  ancillary  findings.  The  following  case \nbased on a real clinical encounter provides an example of premature \nclosure. A 45-year-old man presents with a 3-week history of a \u201cflulike\u201d \nupper respiratory infection (URI) including dyspnea and a productive \ncough.  The  emergency  department  (ED)  clinician  pulled  out  a  \u201cURI \nassessment  form,\u201d  which  defines  and  standardizes  the  information \ngathered. After quickly acquiring the requisite structured examination \ncomponents and noting in particular the absence of fever and a clear \nchest  examination,  the  physician  prescribed  a  cough  suppressant  for \nacute bronchitis and reassured the patient that his illness was not seri-\nous. Following a sleepless night at home with significant dyspnea, the \npatient developed nausea and vomiting and collapsed. He was brought \nback  to  the  ED  in  cardiac  arrest  and  was  unable  to  be  resuscitated. \nHis  autopsy  showed  a  posterior  wall  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  and \na  fresh  thrombus  in  an  atherosclerotic  right  coronary  artery.  What \nwent  wrong?  Presumably,  the  ED  clinician  felt  that  the  patient  was \nbasically healthy (one can be misled by the way the patient appears on \nexamination\u2014a patient that does not appear \u201csick\u201d may be incorrectly \nassumed to have an innocuous illness). So, in this case, the physician, \nupon hearing the overview of the patient from the triage nurse, elected \nto  use  the  URI  assessment  protocol  even  before  starting  the  history, \nclosing consideration of the broader range of possibilities and associ-\nated tests required to confirm or refute these possibilities. In particular, \nby  concentrating  on  the  abbreviated  and  focused  URI  protocol,  the \nclinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which was precipitated \nby exertion and accompanied by chest heaviness and relieved by rest, \nsuggesting a far more serious disorder.\n\nHeuristics  or  rules  of  thumb  are  a  part  of  the  intuitive  system. \nThese  cognitive  shortcuts  provide  a  quick  and  easy  path  to  reaching \nconclusions and making choices, but when used improperly, they can \nlead  to  errors.  Two  major  research  programs  have  studied  heuristics \nin a mostly nonmedical context and have reached very different con-\nclusions about the value of these cognitive tools. The \u201cheuristics and \nbiases\u201d  program  focuses  on  how  these  mental  shortcuts  can  lead  to \nincorrect judgments. So far, however, little evidence exists that educat-\ning physicians and other decision makers to watch for the >100 cogni-\ntive biases identified to date has had any effect on the rate of diagnostic \nerrors.  In  contrast,  the  \u201cfast  and  frugal  heuristics\u201d  research  program \nexplores how and when relying on simple heuristics can produce good \ndecisions. Although many heuristics have relevance to clinical reason-\ning, only four will be mentioned here.\n\nWhen  diagnosing  patients,  clinicians  usually  develop  diagnostic \nhypotheses based on the similarity of that patient\u2019s symptoms, signs, \nand other data to their mental representations (memorized patterns) \nof  the  disease  possibilities.  In  other  words,  clinicians  pattern  match \nto identify the diagnoses that share the most similar findings to the \npatient  at  hand.  This  cognitive  shortcut  is  called  the  representative-\nness  heuristic.  Consider  a  patient  with  hypertension  who  has  head-\nache,  palpitations,  and  diaphoresis.  Based  on  the  representativeness \nheuristic,  clinicians  might  judge  pheochromocytoma  to  be  quite \nlikely  given  this  classic  presenting  symptom  triad  suggesting  pheo-\nchromocytoma.  Doing  so,  however,  would  be  incorrect  given  that \nother  causes  of  hypertension  are  much  more  common  than  pheo-\nchromocytoma and this triad of symptoms can occur in patients who \ndo not have it. Thus, clinicians using the representativeness heuristic \nmay overestimate the likelihood of a particular disease based on the \npresence of representative symptoms and signs, failing to account for \nits low underlying prevalence (i.e., the prior, or pretest, probabilities). \nConversely,  atypical  presentations  of  common  diseases  may  lead  to \nunderestimating the likelihood of a particular disease. Thus, inexpe-\nrience with a specific disease and with the breadth of its presentations \nmay also lead to diagnostic delays or errors, e.g., diseases that affect \nmultiple organ systems, such as sarcoid or tuberculosis, may be partic-\nularly challenging to diagnose because of the many different patterns \nthey may manifest.\n\nA  second  commonly  used  cognitive  shortcut,  the  availability  heu-\nristic,  involves  judgments  based  on  how  easily  prior  similar  cases  or \noutcomes can be brought to mind. For example, a clinician may recall \n\na case from a morbidity and mortality conference in which an elderly \npatient presented with painless dyspnea of acute onset and was eval-\nuated for a pulmonary cause but was eventually found to have acute \nMI, with the diagnostic delay likely contributing to the development of \nischemic cardiomyopathy. If the case was associated with a malpractice \naccusation, such examples may be even more memorable. Errors with \nthe availability heuristic arise from several sources of recall bias. Rare \ncatastrophic  outcomes  become  memorable  cases  with  a  clarity  and \nforce  disproportionate  to  their  likelihood  for  future  diagnosis\u2014for \nexample, a patient with a sore throat eventually found to have leuke-\nmia  or  a  young  athlete  with  leg  pain  subsequently  found  to  have  an  \nosteosarcoma\u2014and those publicized in the media or recently experi-\nenced are, of course, easier to recall and therefore more influential on \nclinical judgments.\n\nThe  third  commonly  used  cognitive  shortcut,  the  anchoring  heu-\nristic  (also  called  conservatism  or  stickiness),  involves  insufficiently \nadjusting  the  initial  probability  of  disease  up  (or  down)  following  a \npositive  (or  negative  test)  when  compared  with  Bayes\u2019  theorem,  i.e., \nsticking to the initial diagnosis. For example, a clinician may still judge \nthe probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) to be high despite a \nnegative  exercise  perfusion  test  and  go  on  to  cardiac  catheterization \n(see \u201cMeasures of Disease Probability and Bayes\u2019 Rule,\u201d below).\n\nThe  fourth  heuristic  states  that  clinicians  should  use  the  simplest \nexplanation  possible  that  will  adequately  account  for  the  patient\u2019s \nsymptoms and findings (Occam\u2019s razor or, alternatively, the simplicity \nheuristic).  Although  this  is  an  attractive  and  often  used  principle,  it \nis  important  to  remember  that  no  biologic  basis  for  it  exists.  Errors \nfrom the simplicity heuristic include premature closure leading to the \nneglect of unexplained significant symptoms or findings.\n\nFor complex or unfamiliar diagnostic problems, clinicians typically \nresort to analytic reasoning processes (System 2) and proceed method-\nically  using  the  hypothetico-deductive  model  of  reasoning.  Based  on \nthe  patient\u2019s  stated  reasons  for  seeking  medical  attention,  clinicians \ndevelop an initial list of diagnostic possibilities in hypothesis generation. \nDuring the history of the present illness, the initial hypotheses evolve \nin  diagnostic  refinement  as  emerging  information  is  tested  against \nthe  mental  models  of  the  diseases  being  considered  with  diagnoses \nincreasing  and  decreasing  in  likelihood  or  even  being  dropped  from \nconsideration as the working hypotheses of the moment. These mental \nmodels often generate additional questions that distinguish the diag-\nnostic possibilities from one another. The focused physical examina-\ntion  contributes  to  further  distinguishing  the  working  hypotheses.  Is \nthe spleen enlarged? How big is the liver? Is it tender? Are there any \npalpable masses or nodules? Diagnostic verification involves testing the \nadequacy (whether the diagnosis accounts for all symptoms and signs) \nand coherency (whether the signs and symptoms are consistent with \nthe  underlying  pathophysiologic  causal  mechanism)  of  the  working \ndiagnosis.  For  example,  if  the  enlarged  and  quite  tender  liver  felt  on \nphysical  examination  is  due  to  acute  hepatitis  (the  hypothesis),  then \ncertain specific liver function tests will be markedly elevated (the pre-\ndiction). Should the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have \nto be discarded and others reconsidered.\n\nAlthough  often  neglected,  negative  findings  are  as  important  as \npositive  ones  because  they  reduce  the  likelihood  of  the  diagnostic \nhypotheses under consideration. Chest discomfort that is not provoked \nor worsened by exertion and not relieved by rest in an active patient \nlowers the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart disease is the under-\nlying  cause.  The  absence  of  a  resting  tachycardia  and  thyroid  gland \nenlargement  reduces  the  likelihood  of  hyperthyroidism  in  a  patient \nwith paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe acuity of a patient\u2019s illness may override considerations of prev-\nalence  and  the  other  issues  described  above.  \u201cDiagnostic  imperatives\u201d \nrecognize the significance of relatively rare but potentially catastrophic \nconditions if undiagnosed and untreated. For example, clinicians should \nconsider aortic dissection routinely as a possible cause of acute severe \nchest discomfort. Although the typical presenting symptoms of dissec-\ntion  differ  from  those  of  MI,  dissection  may  mimic  MI,  and  because \nit  is  far  less  prevalent  and  potentially  fatal  if  mistreated,  diagnosing \ndissection  remains  a  challenging  diagnostic  imperative  (Chap.  280). \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   22\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

When  these  are  all  negative,  clinicians  \nmay feel sufficiently reassured to discard the aortic dissection hypothe-\nsis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, \nthe  hypothesis  should  be  reinstated  and  an  appropriate  imaging  test \nordered (e.g., thoracic computed tomography [CT] scan or transesoph-\nageal  echocardiogram).  In  nonacute  situations,  the  prevalence  of \npotential  alternative  diagnoses  should  play  a  much  more  prominent \nrole in diagnostic hypothesis generation.\n\nCognitive scientists studying the thought processes of expert clini-\ncians have observed that clinicians group data into packets, or \u201cchunks,\u201d \nthat are stored in short-term or \u201cworking memory\u201d and manipulated to \ngenerate diagnostic hypotheses. Because short-term memory is limited \n(classically humans can accurately repeat a list of 7 \u00b1 2 numbers read \nto them), the number of diagnoses that can be actively considered in \nhypothesis-generating activities is similarly limited. For this reason, the \ncognitive shortcuts discussed above play a key role in the generation \nof  diagnostic  hypotheses,  many  of  which  are  discarded  as  rapidly  as \nthey  are  formed,  thereby  demonstrating  that  the  distinction  between \nanalytic  and  intuitive  reasoning  is  an  arbitrary  and  simplistic,  but \nnonetheless useful, representation of cognition.\n\nResearch into the hypothetico-deductive model of reasoning has had \ndifficulty identifying the elements of the reasoning process that distin-\nguish experts from novices. This has led to a shift from examining the \nproblem-solving process of experts to analyzing the organization of their \nknowledge  for  pattern  matching  as  exemplars,  prototypes,  and  illness \nscripts. For example, diagnosis may be based on the resemblance of a new \ncase to patients seen previously (exemplars). As abstract mental models \nof disease, prototypes incorporate the likelihood of various disease fea-\ntures. Illness scripts include risk factors, pathophysiology, and symptoms \nand signs. Experts have a much larger store of exemplar and prototype \ncases,  an  example  of  which  is  the  visual  long-term  memory  of  experi-\nenced radiologists. However, clinicians do not simply rely on literal recall \nof specific cases but have constructed elaborate conceptual networks of \nmemorized information or models of disease to aid in arriving at their \nconclusions  (illness  scripts).  That  is,  expertise  involves  an  enhanced \nability  to  connect  symptoms,  signs,  and  risk  factors  to  one  another  in \nmeaningful ways; relate those findings to possible diagnoses; and identify \nthe additional information necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nNo  single  theory  accounts  for  all  the  key  features  of  expertise  in \nmedical  diagnosis.  Experts  have  more  knowledge  about  presenting \nsymptoms  of  diseases  and  a  larger  repertoire  of  cognitive  tools  to \nemploy in problem solving than nonexperts. One definition of exper-\ntise highlights the ability to make powerful distinctions. In this sense, \nexpertise involves a working knowledge of the diagnostic possibilities \nand those features that distinguish one disease from another. Memo-\nrization alone is insufficient, e.g., photographic memory of a medical \ntextbook would not make one an expert. But having access to detailed \ncase-specific  relevant  information  is  critically  important.  In  the  past, \nclinicians primarily acquired clinical knowledge through their patient \nexperiences, but now clinicians have access to a plethora of information \nsources. Clinicians of the future will be able to leverage the experiences \nof  large  numbers  of  other  clinicians  using  electronic  tools,  but,  as \nwith  the  memorized  textbook,  the  data  alone  will  be  insufficient  for \nbecoming  an  expert.  Nonetheless,  availability  of  these  data  removes \none barrier for acquiring experience with connecting symptoms, signs, \nand risk factors to the possible diagnoses and identifying the additional \ndistinguishing information necessary to confirm the diagnosis, thereby \npotentially facilitating the development of the working knowledge nec-\nessary for becoming an expert.\n\nDespite all of the research seeking to understand expertise in med-\nicine and other disciplines, it remains uncertain whether any didactic \nprogram can actually accelerate the progression from novice to expert \nor from experienced clinician to master clinician. Deliberate effortful \npractice (over an extended period of time, sometimes said to be 10 years \nor  10,000  practice  hours)  and  personal  coaching  are  two  strategies \noften used outside medicine (e.g., music, athletics, chess) to cultivate \n\nexpertise. Their use in developing medical expertise and maintaining \nor  enhancing  it  has  not  yet  been  adequately  explored.  Some  studies \nin  medicine  suggest  that  the  most  beneficial  approach  to  education \nexposes students to both the signs and symptoms of specific diseases \n(disease pattern recognition) and, in addition, the lists of diseases that \ncan present with specific symptoms and signs (differential diagnosis). \nActive  learning  opportunities  useful  for  those  in  training  include \ndeveloping  a  personal  learning  system,  e.g.,  systematically  reflecting \non  diagnostic  processes  used  (metacognition)  and  following-up  to \nidentify diagnoses and treatments for patients in their care.\n\n \u25a0 DIAGNOSTIC VERSUS THERAPEUTIC \nDECISION-MAKING\nThe modern ideal of medical therapeutic decision-making is to \u201cper-\nsonalize\u201d  treatment  recommendations.  In  the  abstract,  personalizing \ntreatment involves combining the best available evidence about what \nworks  with  an  individual  patient\u2019s  unique  features  (e.g.,  risk  factors, \ngenomics,  and  comorbidities)  and  his  or  her  preferences  and  health \ngoals to craft an optimal treatment recommendation with the patient. \nOperationally, two different and complementary levels of personaliza-\ntion are possible: individualizing the risk of harm and benefit for the \noptions being considered based on the specific patient characteristics \n(precision  medicine),  and  personalizing  the  therapeutic  decision \nprocess  by  incorporating  the  patient\u2019s  preferences  and  values  for  the \npossible  health  outcomes.  This  latter  process  is  sometimes  referred \nto as shared decision-making and typically involves clinicians sharing \ntheir  knowledge  about  the  options  and  the  associated  consequences \nand trade-offs and patients sharing their health goals (e.g., avoiding a \nshort-term  risk  of  dying  from  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting  to  see \ntheir grandchild get married in a few months).\n\nIndividualizing the evidence about therapy does not mean relying \non  physician  impressions  of  benefit  and  harm  from  their  personal \nexperience. Because of small sample sizes and rare events, the chance \nof drawing erroneous causal inferences from one\u2019s own clinical experi-\nence is very high. For most chronic diseases, therapeutic effectiveness \nis only demonstrable statistically in large patient populations. It would \nbe  incorrect  to  infer  with  any  certainty,  for  example,  that  treating \na  hypertensive  patient  with  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) \ninhibitors necessarily prevented a stroke from occurring during treat-\nment, or that an untreated patient would definitely have avoided their \nstroke  had  they  been  treated.  For  many  chronic  diseases,  a  majority \nof  patients  will  remain  event  free  regardless  of  treatment  choices; \nsome  will  have  events  regardless  of  which  treatment  is  selected;  and \nthose  who  avoided  having  an  event  through  treatment  cannot  be \nindividually  identified.  Blood pressure  lowering,  a  readily  observable \nsurrogate endpoint, does not have a tightly coupled relationship with \nstrokes  prevented.  Consequently,  in  most  situations,  demonstrating \ntherapeutic effectiveness cannot rely simply on observing the outcome \nof an individual patient but should instead be based on large groups of \npatients carefully studied and properly analyzed.\n\nTherapeutic decision-making, therefore, should be based on the best \navailable evidence from clinical trials and well-done outcome studies. \nTrustworthy clinical practice guidelines that synthesize such evidence \noffer  normative  guidance  for  many  testing  and  treatment  decisions. \nHowever,  all  guidelines  recognize  that  \u201cone  size  fits  all\u201d  recommen-\ndations may not apply to individual patients. Increased research into \nthe heterogeneity of treatment effects seeks to understand how best to \nadjust group-level clinical evidence of treatment harms and benefits to \naccount for the absolute level of risks faced by subgroups and even by \nindividual patients, using, for example, validated clinical risk scores.\n\n \u25a0 NONCLINICAL INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL \nDECISION-MAKING\nMore than three decades of research on variations in clinician practice \npatterns  has  identified  important  nonclinical  forces  that  shape  clin-\nical  decisions.  These  factors  can  be  grouped  conceptually  into  three \noverlapping categories: (1) factors related to an individual physician\u2019s \npractice, (2) factors related to practice setting, and (3) factors related \nto payment systems.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   23\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n"

Factors that influence \nperformance  in  this  role  include  the  physician\u2019s  knowledge,  training, \nand  experience.  Clearly,  physicians  cannot  practice  EBM  if  they  are \nunfamiliar with the evidence. As would be expected, specialists gener-\nally know the evidence in their field better than do generalists. Beyond \npublished evidence and practice guidelines, a major set of influences \non physician practice can be subsumed under the general concept of \n\u201cpractice  style.\u201d  The  practice  style  serves  to  define  norms  of  clinical \nbehavior. Differing practice styles may be based on training, personal \nexperience, and medical evidence. Beliefs about effectiveness of differ-\nent therapies and preferred patterns of diagnostic test use are examples \nof different facets of a practice style. For example, cardiologists eval-\nuating patients with lower risk chest pain symptoms often conceptu-\nalize  their  primary  diagnostic  objective  as  maximizing  the  detection \nof  ischemia.  For  this  reason,  they  may  strongly  favor  stress  imaging. \nInternists caring for the same patients may be more comfortable with \ninitial use of exercise ECG testing without imaging. This latter practice \nstyle focuses less on ischemia detection and more on following guide-\nline  recommendations  that  indicate  no  outcome  advantage  for  stress \nimaging in this context. Cardiologist may also favor a more liberal use \nof coronary angiography and revascularization in patients with stable \nischemic symptoms relative to general internists.\n\nBeyond the patient\u2019s welfare, physician perceptions about the risk of \na malpractice suit resulting from either an erroneous decision or a bad \noutcome may drive clinical decisions and create a practice referred to \nas defensive medicine. This practice involves ordering tests and ther-\napies with very small marginal benefits, ostensibly to preclude future \ncriticism should an adverse outcome occur. With conscious or uncon-\nscious awareness of a connection to the risk of litigation or to payment, \nhowever, over time, such patterns of care may become accepted as part \nof the practice norm, thereby perpetuating their overuse, e.g., annual \ncardiac exercise testing in asymptomatic patients.\n\nPractice  Setting  Factors  Factors  in  this  category  relate  to  work \nsystems  including  tasks  and  workflow  (interruptions,  inefficiencies, \nworkload), technology (poor design or implementation, errors in use, \nfailure,  misuse),  organizational  characteristics  (e.g.,  culture,  leader-\nship,  staffing,  scheduling),  and  the  physical  environment  (e.g.,  noise, \nlighting,  layout).  Physician-induced  demand  is  a  term  that  refers  to \nthe repeated observation that once medical facilities and technologies \nbecome available to physicians, they will find ways to use them. Other \nenvironmental factors that can influence decision-making include the \nlocal availability of specialists for consultations and procedures; \u201chigh-\ntech\u201d advanced imaging or procedure facilities such as MRI machines \nand proton beam therapy centers; and fragmentation of care.\n\nPayment Systems  Economic  incentives  are  closely  related  to  the \nother two categories of practice-modifying factors. Financial issues can \nexert  both  stimulatory  and  inhibitory  influences  on  clinical  practice. \nHistorically,  physicians  are  paid  on  a  fee-for-service,  capitation,  or \nsalary basis. In fee-for-service, physicians who do more get paid more, \nthereby encouraging overuse, consciously or unconsciously. When fees \nare  reduced  (discounted  reimbursement),  clinicians  tend  to  increase \nthe  number  of  services  provided  to  maintain  revenue.  Capitation,  in \ncontrast, provides a fixed payment per patient per year to encourage \nphysicians to consider a global population budget in managing indi-\nvidual patients and ideally reducing the use of interventions with small \nmarginal  benefit.  To  discourage  volume-based  excessive  utilization, \nfixed salary compensation plans pay physicians the same regardless of \nthe clinical effort expended but may provide an (unintended) incen-\ntive  to  see  fewer  patients.  In  recognition  of  the  nonsustainability  of \ncontinued growth in medical expenditures and the opportunity costs \nassociated  with  that  (funds  that  might  be  more  beneficially  applied \nto  education,  energy,  social  welfare,  or  defense),  current  efforts  seek  \nto transition to a value-based payment system to reduce overuse and to \nreflect benefit. Work to define how to actually tie payment to value has \nmostly focused so far on \u201cpay for performance\u201d models. High-quality \n\nclinical  trial  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  these  models  is  still  \nmostly lacking.\n \u25a0 INTERPRETATION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\nDespite  impressive  technological  advances  in  medicine  over  the  past \ncentury, uncertainty still abounds and challenges all aspects of medical \ndecision-making.  Compounding  this  challenge,  massive  information \noverload  characterizes  modern  medicine.  Clinicians  on  average  sub-\nscribe to seven journals, presenting them with >2500 new articles each \nyear,  and  need  access  to  2  million  pieces  of  information  to  practice \nmedicine. Of course, to be useful, this information must be sifted for \nquality  and  examined  for  applicability  for  integration  into  patient- \nspecific care. Although computers appear to offer an obvious solution \nboth  for  information  management  and  for  quantification  of  medical \ncare uncertainties, many practical problems remain to be solved before \ncomputerized decision support can be routinely incorporated into the \nclinical  reasoning  process  in  a  way  that  demonstrably  improves  the \nquality of care. For the present, understanding the nature of diagnostic \ntest  information  can  help  clinicians  become  more  efficient  users  of \nsuch data. The next section reviews select concepts related to diagnos-\ntic testing.\n \u25a0 DIAGNOSTIC TESTING: MEASURES OF TEST \nACCURACY\nThe  purpose  of  performing  a  test  on  a  patient  is  to  reduce  uncer-\ntainty  about  the  patient\u2019s  diagnosis  or  prognosis  in  order  to  facilitate \nappropriate  management.  Although  diagnostic  tests  commonly  refer \nto  laboratory  (e.g.,  blood  count)  or  imaging  tests  or  procedures  (e.g., \ncolonoscopy or bronchoscopy), any information that changes a provider\u2019s  \nunderstanding  of  the  patient\u2019s  problem  qualifies  as  a  diagnostic  test. \nThus,  even  the  history  and  physical  examination  can  be  considered \nas  diagnostic  tests.  In  clinical  medicine,  it  is  common  to  reduce  the \nresults of a test to a dichotomous outcome, such as positive or negative, \nnormal  or  abnormal.  Although  this  simplification  often  suppresses \nuseful  information  (such  as  the  degree  of  abnormality),  it  facilitates \nillustrating  some  important  principles  of  test  interpretation  that  are \ndescribed below.\n\nThe  accuracy  of  any  diagnostic  test  is  assessed  relative  to  a  \u201cgold \nstandard,\u201d where a positive gold standard test defines the patients who \nhave disease and a negative test securely rules out disease (Table 4-1). \nCharacterizing  the  diagnostic  performance  of  a  new  test  requires \nidentifying an appropriate population (ideally, patients representative \nof those in whom the new test would be used) and applying both the \nnew  and  the  gold  standard  tests  to  all  subjects.  Biased  estimates  of \ntest performance occur when diagnostic accuracy is defined using an \ninappropriate  population  or  one  in  which  gold  standard  determina-\ntion  of  disease  status  is  incomplete.  The  accuracy  of  the  new  test  in \ndistinguishing  disease  from  health  is  determined  relative  to  the  gold \nstandard results and summarized in four estimates. The sensitivity or \ntrue-positive rate reflects how well the new test identifies patients with \ndisease.  It  is  the  proportion  of  patients  with  disease  (defined  by  the \ngold standard) who have a positive test. The proportion of patients with \ndisease who have a negative test is the false-negative rate, calculated as \n1 \u2013 sensitivity. The specificity, or true-negative rate, reflects how well \n\nTABLE 4-1  Measures of Diagnostic Test Accuracy\n\nDISEASE STATUS\n\nTEST RESULT\nPositive\nNegative\n\nPRESENT\nTrue positives (TP)\nFalse negatives (FN)\n\nABSENT\nFalse positives (FP)\nTrue negatives (TN)\n\nTest Characteristics in Patients with Disease\n\nTrue-positive rate (sensitivity) = TP/(TP + FN)\nFalse-negative rate = FN/(TP + FN) = 1 \u2013 true-positive rate\n\nTest Characteristics in Patients without Disease\n\nTrue-negative rate (specificity) = TN/(TN + FP)\nFalse-positive rate = FP/(TN + FP) = 1 \u2013 true-negative rate\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   24\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine\u00a0\n"

    "text": "the new test correctly identifies patients without disease. It is the pro-\nportion of patients without disease (defined by the gold standard) who \nhave  a  negative  test.  The  proportion  of  patients  without  disease  who \nhave positive test is the false-positive rate, calculated as 1 \u2013 specificity. \nIn theory, a perfect test would be one with a sensitivity of 100% and \na specificity of 100% and would completely distinguish patients with \ndisease from those without it. A useful mnemonic to help remember \nthe somewhat paradoxical relationship between what the test is best at \ntechnically versus what it is most useful for clinically is: a test with a \nvery high sensitivity (Sn) when negative (N) helps rule out (out) disease \n(SnNout), and a test with a very high specificity (Sp) when positive (P) \nhelps rule in (in) disease (SpPin).\n\nCalculating sensitivity and specificity requires selection of a thresh-\nold  value  or  cut  point  above  which  the  test  is  considered  \u201cpositive.\u201d \nMaking  the  cut  point  \u201cstricter\u201d  (e.g.,  raising  it)  lowers  sensitivity  but \nimproves  specificity,  while  making  it  \u201claxer\u201d  (e.g.,  lowering  it)  raises \nsensitivity but lowers specificity. This dynamic trade-off between more \naccurate  identification  of  subjects  with  disease  versus  those  without \ndisease  is  often  displayed  graphically  as  a  receiver  operating  charac-\nteristic  (ROC)  curve  (Fig.  4-1)  by  plotting  sensitivity  (y  axis)  versus \n1 \u2013 specificity (x axis). Each point on the curve represents a potential \ncut point with an associated sensitivity and specificity value. The area \nunder  the  ROC  curve  often  is  used  as  a  quantitative  measure  of  the \ninformation  content  of  a  test.  Values  range  from  0.5  (no  diagnostic \ninformation from testing at all; the test is equivalent to flipping a coin) \nto  1.0  (perfect  test).  The  choice  of  cut  point  should  in  theory  reflect \nthe relative harms and benefits of treatment for those without versus \nthose with disease. For example, if treatment was safe with substantial \nbenefit, then choosing a high-sensitivity cut point (upper right of the \nROC curve) for a low-risk test may be appropriate (e.g., phenylketon-\nuria in newborns), but if treatment had substantial risk for harm, then \nchoosing a high-specificity cut point (lower left of the ROC curve) may \nbe appropriate (e.g., chemotherapy for cancer). The choice of cut point \nmay  also  depend  on  the  prevalence  of  disease,  with  low  prevalence \nplacing  a  greater  emphasis  on  the  harms  of  false-positive  tests  (e.g., \nHIV testing in marriage applicants) or the harms of false-negative tests \n(e.g., HIV testing in blood donors).\n\ne\nt\na\nr\ne\nv\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\n-\ne\nu\nr\nT\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\nGood\n\nFair\nNo predictive value\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nFalse-positive rate\n\nFIGURE 4-1  Each receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve) illustrates a trade-\noff  that  occurs  between  improved  test  sensitivity  (accurate  detection  of  patients \nwith disease) and improved test specificity (accurate detection of patients without \ndisease), as the test value defining when the test turns from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cpositive\u201d \nis  varied.  A  45\u00b0  line  would  indicate  a  test  with  no  predictive  value  (sensitivity  = \nspecificity  at  every  test  value).  The  area  under  each  ROC  curve  is  a  measure  of \nthe  information  content  of  the  test.  Thus,  a  larger  ROC  area  signifies  increased \ndiagnostic accuracy.\n\n \u25a0 MEASURES OF DISEASE PROBABILITY AND \nBAYES\u2019 RULE\nIn  the  absence  of  perfect  tests,  the  true  disease  state  of  the  patient \nremains uncertain after every test. Bayes\u2019 rule provides a way to quan-\ntify the revised uncertainty using simple probability mathematics (and \nthereby  avoid  anchoring  bias).  It  calculates  the  posttest  probability, \nor likelihood of disease after a test result, from three parameters: the \npretest probability of disease, the test sensitivity, and the test specificity. \nThe pretest probability is a quantitative estimate of the likelihood of the \ndiagnosis  before  the  test  is  performed  and  is  usually  estimated  from \nthe prevalence of the disease in the underlying population (if known) \nor  clinical  context  (e.g.,  age,  sex,  and  type  of  chest  pain).  For  some \ncommon conditions, such as CAD, existing nomograms and statistical \nmodels generate estimates of pretest probability that account for his-\ntory, physical examination, and test findings. The posttest probability \n(also called the predictive value of the test, see below) is a recalibrated \nstatement of the probability of the diagnosis, accounting for both pre-\ntest probability and test results. For the probability of disease following \na positive test (i.e., positive predictive value), Bayes\u2019 rule is calculated \nas:\n\nPosttest probability\n\n=\n\nPretest probability test sensitivity\n+\nPretest probability test sensitivity\n\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n25\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n4\n\nD\ne\nc\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\n-\nM\na\nk\ni\nn\ng\ni\nn\nC\n\nl\ni\nn\ni\nc\na\nl\n\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\ni\nn\ne\n\n(1\u2013 Pretest probability)\n(false-positive test rate)\n\n\u00d7\n\nFor  example,  consider  a  64-year-old  woman  with  atypical  chest  pain \nwho  has  a  pretest  probability  of  0.50  and  a  \u201cpositive\u201d  diagnostic  test \nresult (assuming test sensitivity = 0.90 and specificity = 0.90).\n\nPosttest probability\n\n=\n\n=\n\n(0.50)(0.90)\n+\n\n(0.50)(0.10)\n\n(0.50)(0.90)\n0.90\n\nThe  term  predictive  value  has  often  been  used  as  a  synonym  for  the \nposttest  probability.  Unfortunately,  clinicians  commonly  misinterpret \nreported predictive values as intrinsic measures of test accuracy rather \nthan  calculated  probabilities.  Studies  of  diagnostic  test  performance \ncompound  the  confusion  by  calculating  predictive  values  from  the \nsame sample used to measure sensitivity and specificity. Such calcula-\ntions are misleading unless the test is applied subsequently to popula-\ntions with exactly the same disease prevalence. For these reasons, the \nterm predictive value is best avoided in favor of the more descriptive \nposttest probability following a positive or a negative test result.\n\nThe nomogram version of Bayes\u2019 rule (Fig. 4-2) helps us to under-\nstand at a conceptual level how it estimates the posttest probability of \ndisease. In this nomogram, the impact of the diagnostic test result is \nsummarized  by  the  likelihood  ratio,  which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of \nthe probability of a given test result (e.g., \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d) in a \npatient with disease to the probability of that result in a patient without \ndisease, thereby providing a measure of how well the test distinguishes \nthose with from those without disease.\n\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive test is calculated as the ratio of the \ntrue-positive rate to the false-positive rate (or sensitivity/[1 \u2013 specificity]). \nFor example, a test with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.90 \nhas a likelihood ratio of 0.90/(1 \u2013 0.90), or 9. Thus, for this hypothet-\nical test, a \u201cpositive\u201d result is 9 times more likely in a patient with the \ndisease than in a patient without it. Most tests in medicine have like-\nlihood  ratios  for  a  positive  result  between  1.5  and  20.  Higher  values \nare  associated  with  tests  that  more  substantially  increase  the  posttest \nlikelihood of disease. A very high likelihood ratio positive (>10) usually \nimplies  high  specificity,  so  a  positive  high  specificity  test  helps  \u201crule \nin\u201d disease (the \u201cSpPin\u201d mnemonic introduced earlier). If sensitivity is \nexcellent but specificity is less so, the likelihood ratio positive will be \nreduced substantially (e.g., with a 90% sensitivity but a 55% specificity, \nthe likelihood ratio positive is 2.0).\n\nThe corresponding likelihood ratio for a negative test is the ratio of the \nfalse-negative rate to the true-negative rate (or [1 \u2013 sensitivity]/specificity). \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   25\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

A  positive  treadmill \nST-segment response has an average sensitivity of ~60% and an average \nspecificity  of  ~75%,  yielding  a  likelihood  ratio  positive  of  2.4  (0.60/ \n[1  \u2013  0.75])  (consistent  with  modest  discriminatory  ability  because  it \nfalls between 2 and 5). For a 41-year-old man with nonanginal pain and \na  10%  pretest  probability  of  CAD,  the  posttest  probability  of  disease \nafter a positive result rises to only ~30%. For a 60-year-old woman with \ntypical angina and a pretest probability of CAD of 80%, a positive test \nresult raises the posttest probability of disease to ~95%.\n\nIn contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more accu-\nrate for diagnosis of CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding of a \nreversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a sensitivity and \n\n99\n\n98\n\n95\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n50\n\n40\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\na  specificity  of  90%  (a  bit  higher  than \nreported), yielding a likelihood ratio for \na  positive  test  of  9.0  (0.90/[1  \u2013  0.90]) \n(consistent  with  intermediate  discrim-\ninatory  ability  because  it  falls  between \n5  and  10).  For  the  same  10%  pretest \nprobability patient, a positive test raises \nthe  probability  of  CAD  to  50%  (Fig. \n4-2). However, despite the differences in \nposttest probabilities between these two \ntests (30 vs 50%), the more accurate test \nmay  not  improve  diagnostic  likelihood \nenough  to  change  patient  management \n(e.g.,  decision  to  refer  to  cardiac  cath-\neterization)  because  the  more  accurate \ntest has only moved the physician from \nbeing  fairly  certain  that  the  patient \ndid  not  have  CAD  to  a  50:50  chance \nof  disease.  In  a  patient  with  a  pretest \nprobability of 80%, exercise SPECT test \nraises  the  posttest  probability  to  97% \n(compared  with  95%  for  the  exercise \ntreadmill). Again, the more accurate test \ndoes  not  provide  enough  improvement \nin posttest confidence to alter manage-\nment,  and  neither  test  has  improved \nmuch on what was known from clinical \ndata alone.\n\n50\n\n20\n10\n5\n\n2\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nLikelihood\nRatio\n\nPosttest\nProbability, %\n\nIn  general,  positive  results  with  an \naccurate  test  (e.g.,  likelihood  ratio  for \na  positive  test  of  10)  when  the  pretest \nprobability  is  low  (e.g.,  20%)  do  not \nmove the posttest probability to a range \nhigh  enough  to  rule  in  disease  (e.g., \n80%).  In  screening  situations,  pretest \nprobabilities  are  often  particularly  low \nbecause  patients  are  asymptomatic.  In \nsuch  cases,  specificity  becomes  espe-\ncially important. For example, in screen-\ning  first-time  female  blood  donors \nwithout  risk  factors  for  HIV,  a  positive \ntest raised the likelihood of HIV to only \n67%  despite  a  specificity  of  99.995% \nbecause  the  prevalence  was  0.01%.  Conversely,  with  a  high  pretest \nprobability, a negative test may not rule out disease adequately if it is \nnot sufficiently sensitive. Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likeli-\nhood following a test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain \n(i.e., pretest probability between 30 and 70%). For example, in patients \nwith  a  pretest  probability  for  CAD  of  50%,  a  positive  exercise  tread-\nmill test moves the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise \nSPECT perfusion test moves it to 90% (Fig. 4-2).\n\nAs  presented  above,  Bayes\u2019  rule  employs  a  number  of  important \nsimplifications that should be considered. First, few tests provide only \n\u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d results. Many tests have multidimensional out-\ncomes  (e.g.,  extent  of  ST-segment  depression,  exercise  duration,  and \nexercise-induced  symptoms  with  exercise  testing).  Although  Bayes\u2019 \ntheorem  can  be  adapted  to  this  more  detailed  test  result  format,  it \nis  computationally  more  complex  to  do  so.  Similarly,  when  multiple \nsequential  tests  are  performed,  the  posttest  probability  may  be  used \nas  the  pretest  probability  to  interpret  the  second  test.  However,  this \nsimplification  assumes  conditional  independence\u2014that  is,  that  the \nresults of the first test do not affect the likelihood of the second test \nresult\u2014and this is often not true.\n\nFinally,  many  texts  assert  that  sensitivity  and  specificity  are  \nprevalence-independent parameters of test accuracy. This statistically \nuseful  assumption,  however,  is  often  incorrect.  A  treadmill  exercise \ntest, for example, has a sensitivity of ~30% in a population of patients \nwith  one-vessel  CAD,  whereas  its  sensitivity  in  patients  with  severe \nthree-vessel CAD approaches 80%.

    "text": "to use in a particular decision may vary, depending on the severity of \ndisease in the local population. A hospitalized, symptomatic, or referral \npopulation typically has a higher prevalence of disease and, in particu-\nlar, a higher prevalence of more advanced disease than does an outpa-\ntient population. Consequently, test sensitivity will likely be higher in \nhospitalized patients and test specificity higher in outpatients.\n \u25a0 STATISTICAL PREDICTION MODELS\nBayes\u2019 rule, when used as presented above, is useful in studying diag-\nnostic testing concepts, but predictions based on multivariable statisti-\ncal models can more accurately address these more complex problems \nby simultaneously accounting for additional relevant patient character-\nistics. In particular, these models explicitly account for multiple, even \npossibly overlapping, pieces of patient-specific information and assign \na relative weight to each on the basis of its unique independent contri-\nbution to the prediction in question. For example, a logistic regression \nmodel to predict the probability of CAD ideally considers all the rele-\nvant independent factors from the clinical examination and diagnostic \ntesting  and  their  relative  importance  instead  of  the  limited  data  that \nclinicians  can  manage  in  their  heads  or  with  Bayes\u2019  rule.  However, \ndespite this strength, prediction models are usually too complex com-\nputationally to use without a calculator or computer. Guideline-driven \ntreatment  recommendations  based  on  statistical  prediction  models \navailable  online,  e.g.,  the  American  College  of  Cardiology/American \nHeart Association risk calculator for primary prevention with statins \nand the CHA2DS2-VASC calculator for anticoagulation for atrial fibril-\nlation, have generated more widespread usage. When electronic health \nrecords  (EHRs)  will  provide  sufficient  platform  support  to  allow  for \nroutine use of predictive models in clinical practice and increase their \nimpact on clinical encounters and outcomes remains uncertain.\n\nOne reason for limited clinical use is that, to date, only a handful \nof  prediction  models  have  been  validated  sufficiently  (for  example, \nWells  criteria  for  pulmonary  embolism;  Table  4-2).  The  importance \nof independent validation in a population separate from the one used \nto develop the model cannot be overstated. An unvalidated prediction \nmodel should be viewed with the skepticism appropriate for any new \ndrug or medical device that has not had rigorous clinical trial testing.\n\nWhen  statistical  survival  models  in  cancer  and  heart  disease  have \nbeen compared directly with clinicians\u2019 predictions, the survival mod-\nels have been found to be more consistent, as would be expected, but \nnot always more accurate. On the other hand, comparison of clinicians \nwith  websites  and  apps  that  generate  lists  of  possible  diagnoses  to \nhelp patients with self-diagnosis found that physicians outperformed \nthe  currently  available  programs.  For  students  and  less-experienced \nclinicians, the biggest value of diagnostic decision support may be in \nextending  diagnostic  possibilities  and  triggering  \u201crational  override,\u201d \nbut  their  impact  on  knowledge,  information-seeking,  and  problem-\nsolving needs additional research.\n\nTABLE 4-2  Wells Clinical Prediction Rule for Pulmonary  \nEmbolism (PE)\nCLINICAL FEATURE\nClinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis\nAlternative diagnosis is less likely than PE\nHeart rate >100 beats/min\nImmobilization \u22653 days or surgery in previous \n4 weeks\nHistory of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary \nembolism\nHemoptysis\nMalignancy (with treatment within 6 months) \nor palliative\n\nPOINTS\n3\n3\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n1\n\nINTERPRETATION\nScore >6.0\nScore 2.0\u20136.0\nScore <2.0\n\nHigh\nIntermediate\nLow\n\n27\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n4\n\nD\ne\nc\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\n-\nM\na\nk\ni\nn\ng\ni\nn\nC\n\nl\ni\nn\ni\nc\na\nl\n\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\ni\nn\ne\n\nFORMAL DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS\n \u25a0 DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS\nOver  the  past  50  years,  many  attempts  have  been  made  to  develop \ncomputer  systems  to  aid  clinical  decision-making  and  patient  man-\nagement.  Conceptually,  computers  offer  several  levels  of  potentially \nuseful  support  for  clinicians.  At  the  most  basic  level,  they  provide \nready access to vast reservoirs of information, which may, however, be \nquite difficult to sort through to find what is needed. At higher levels, \ncomputers can support care management decisions by making accurate \npredictions  of  outcome,  or  can  simulate  the  whole  decision  process, \nand provide algorithmic guidance. Computer-based predictions using \nBayesian or statistical regression models inform a clinical decision but \ndo  not  actually  reach  a  \u201cconclusion\u201d  or  \u201crecommendation.\u201d  Machine \nlearning methods are being applied to pattern recognition tasks such \nas  the  examination  of  skin  lesions  and  the  interpretation  of  x-rays. \nArtificial  intelligence  (AI)  systems  attempt  to  simulate  or  replace \nhuman reasoning with a computer-based analogue. Natural language \nprocessing  allows  the  system  to  access  and  process  large  amounts  of \ndata, both from the EHR and from the medical literature. To date, such \napproaches  have  achieved  only  limited  success.  The  most  prominent \nexample,  IBM\u2019s  Watson  program,  introduced  publicly  in  2011,  has \nyet to produce persuasive evidence of clinical decision support utility. \nReminder  or  protocol-directed  systems  do  not  make  predictions  but \nuse  existing  algorithms,  such  as  guidelines  or  appropriate  utiliza-\ntion  criteria,  to  direct  clinical  practice.  In  general,  however,  decision \nsupport  systems  have  so  far  had  little  impact  on  practice.  Reminder \nsystems built into EHRs have shown the most promise, particularly in \ncorrecting drug dosing and promoting adherence to guidelines. Check-\nlists may also help avoid or reduce errors.\n\n \u25a0 DECISION ANALYSIS\nCompared  with  the  decision  support  methods  discussed  earlier, \ndecision  analysis  represents  a  normative  prescriptive  approach  to \ndecision-making  in  the  face  of  uncertainty.  Its  principal  application \nis  in  complex  decisions.  For  example,  public  health  policy  decisions \noften involve trade-offs in length versus quality of life, benefits versus \nresource  use,  population  versus  individual  health,  and  uncertainty \nregarding efficacy, effectiveness, and adverse events as well as values or \npreferences regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes.\n\nOne  recent  analysis  using  this  approach  involved  the  optimal \nscreening strategy for breast cancer, which has remained controversial, \nin  part  because  a  randomized  controlled  trial  to  determine  when  to \nbegin screening and how often to repeat screening mammography is \nimpractical. In 2016, the National Cancer Institute\u2013sponsored Cancer \nIntervention  and  Surveillance  Network  (CISNET)  examined  eight \nstrategies differing by whether to initiate mammography screening at \nage 40, 45, or 50 years and whether to screen annually, biennially, or \nannually for women in their forties and biennially thereafter (hybrid). \nThe  six  simulation  models  found  biennial  strategies  to  be  the  most \nefficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening for 1000 women \nfrom age 50\u201374 years versus no screening avoided seven breast cancer \ndeaths. Screening annually from age 40\u201374 years avoided three addi-\ntional deaths but required 20,000 additional mammograms and yielded \n1988  more  false-positive  results.  Factors  that  influenced  the  results \nincluded  patients  with  a  2\u20134-fold  higher  risk  for  developing  breast \ncancer in whom annual screening from age 40\u201374 years yielded similar \nbenefits as biennial screening from age 50\u201374. For average-risk patients \nwith  moderate  or  severe  comorbidities,  screening  could  be  stopped \nearlier, at age 66\u201368 years.\n\nThis  analysis  involved  six  models  that  reproduced  epidemiologic \ntrends and a screening trial result, accounted for digital technology and \ntreatments advances, and considered quality of life, risk factors, breast \ndensity, and comorbidity. It provided novel insights into a public health \nproblem in the absence of a randomized clinical trial and helped weigh \nthe pros and cons of such a health policy recommendation. Although \nsuch models have been developed for selected clinical problems, their \nbenefit  and  application  to  individual  real-time  clinical  management \nhas yet to be demonstrated.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   27\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n"

    "text": "28 DIAGNOSIS AS AN ELEMENT OF QUALITY \n\nOF CARE\nHigh-quality  medical  care  begins  with  accurate  diagnosis.  The  inci-\ndence of diagnostic errors has been estimated by a variety of methods \nincluding  postmortem  examinations,  medical  record  reviews,  and \nmedical  malpractice  claims,  with  each  yielding  complementary  but \ndifferent estimates of this quality of care patient-safety problem. In the \npast,  diagnostic  errors  tended  to  be  viewed  as  a  failure  of  individual \nclinicians.  The  modern  view  is  that  they  are  mostly  a  system  of  care \ndeficiencies. Current estimates suggest that nearly everyone will expe-\nrience  at  least  one  diagnostic  error  in  their  lifetime,  leading  to  mor-\ntality, morbidity, unnecessary tests and procedures, costs, and anxiety.\nSolutions  to  the  \u201cdiagnostic  errors  as  a  system  of  care\u201d  problem \nhave  focused  on  system-level  approaches,  such  as  decision  support \nand other tools integrated into EHRs. The use of checklists has been \nproposed as a means of reducing some of the cognitive errors discussed \nearlier in the chapter, such as premature closure. While checklists have \nbeen shown to be useful in certain medical contexts, such as operating \nrooms  and  intensive  care  units,  their  value  in  preventing  diagnostic \nerrors that lead to patient adverse events remains to be shown.\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE\nClinical medicine is defined traditionally as a practice combining med-\nical knowledge (including scientific evidence), intuition, and judgment \nin  the  care  of  patients  (Chap.  1).  Evidence-based  medicine  (EBM) \nupdates this construct by placing much greater emphasis on the pro-\ncesses by which clinicians gain knowledge of the most up-to-date and \nrelevant clinical research to determine for themselves whether medical \ninterventions alter the disease course and improve the length or quality \nof life. The phrase \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d is now used so often and \nin so many different contexts that many practitioners are unaware of \nits original meaning. The intention of the EBM program, as described \nin the early 1990s by its founding proponents at McMaster University, \nbecomes clearer through an examination of its four key steps:\n\n1.  Formulating the management question to be answered\n2.  Searching the literature and online databases for applicable research \n\ndata\n\n3.  Appraising  the  evidence  gathered  with  regard  to  its  validity  and \n\nrelevance\n\n4.  Integrating this appraisal with knowledge about the unique aspects \nof the patient (including the patient\u2019s preferences about the possible \noutcomes)\n\nThe process of searching the world\u2019s research literature and apprais-\ning  the  quality  and  relevance  of  studies  can  be  time-consuming  and \nrequires  skills  and  training  that  most  clinicians  do  not  possess.  In  a \nbusy clinical practice, the work required is also logistically not feasible. \nThis has led to a focus on finding recent systematic overviews of the \nproblem in question as a useful shortcut in the EBM process. System-\natic reviews are regarded by some as the highest level of evidence in the \nEBM hierarchy because they are intended to comprehensively summa-\nrize the available evidence on a particular topic. To avoid the potential \nbiases  found  in  narrative  review  articles,  predefined  reproducible \nexplicit  search  strategies  and  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  seek  to \nfind all of the relevant scientific research and grade its quality. The pro-\ntotype for this kind of resource is the Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews.  When  appropriate,  a  meta-analysis  is  used  to  quantitatively \nsummarize the systematic review findings (discussed further below).\n\nUnfortunately,  systematic  reviews  are  not  uniformly  the  acme  of \nthe  EBM  process  they  were  initially  envisioned  to  be.  In  select  cir-\ncumstances,  they  can  provide  a  much  clearer  picture  of  the  state  of \nthe evidence than is available from any individual clinical report, but \ntheir value is less clear when only a few trials are available, when trials \nand observational studies are mixed, or when the evidence base is only \nobservational. They cannot compensate for deficiencies in the under-\nlying  research  available,  and  many  are  created  without  the  requisite \nclinical insights. The medical literature is now flooded with systematic \n\nreviews of varying quality and clinical utility. The peer review system \nhas,  unfortunately,  not  proved  to  be  an  effective  arbiter  of  quality  of \nthese  papers.  Therefore,  systematic  reviews  should  be  used  with  cir-\ncumspection in conjunction with selective reading of some of the best \nempirical studies.\n\n \u25a0 SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: CLINICAL TRIALS AND \nREGISTRIES\nThe notion of learning from observation of patients is as old as med-\nicine itself. Over the past 50 years, physicians\u2019 understanding of how \nbest to turn raw observation into useful evidence has evolved consid-\nerably.  Medicine  has  received  a  hard  refresher  lesson  in  this  process \nfrom COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in the spring of 2020, case reports, \npersonal  and  institutional  anecdotal  experience,  and  small  single- \ncenter  case  series  started  appearing  in  the  peer-reviewed  literature \nand within months turned into a flood of confusing and often contra-\ndictory evidence. Observational reports of treatments for COVID-19 \nfueled  the  confusion.  Despite  >40,000  publications  appearing  in  the \nfirst 7 months of the pandemic, an enormous amount of uncertainty \naround  prevention,  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  prognosis  of  the  dis-\nease remained. Many of the early 2020 publications were either small \nobservational  series  or  reviews  of  published  series,  neither  of  which \ncan resolve the key uncertainties clinicians need to address in caring \nfor  these  patients.  These  small  observational  studies  often  have  sub-\nstantial limitations in validity and generalizability, and although they \nmay generate important hypotheses or be the first reports of adverse \nevents or therapeutic benefit, they have no role in formulating modern \nstandards of practice. The major tools used to develop reliable evidence \nconsist of randomized clinical trials supplemented strategically by large \n(high-quality) observational registries. A registry or database typically \nis  focused  on  a  disease  or  syndrome  (e.g.,  different  types  of  cancer, \nacute or chronic CAD, pacemaker capture, or chronic heart failure), a \nclinical procedure (e.g., bone marrow transplantation, coronary revas-\ncularization),  or  an  administrative  process  (e.g.,  claims  data  used  for \nbilling and reimbursement).\n\nBy definition, in observational data, the investigator does not con-\ntrol  patient  care.  Carefully  collected  prospective  observational  data, \nhowever, can at times achieve a level of evidence quality approaching \nthat of major clinical trial data. At the other end of the spectrum, data \ncollected  retrospectively  (e.g.,  chart  review)  are  limited  in  form  and \ncontent to what previous observers recorded and may not include the \nspecific  research  data  being  sought  (e.g.,  claims  data).  Advantages  of \nobservational  data  include  the  inclusion  of  a  broader  population  as \nencountered in practice than is typically represented in clinical trials \nbecause of their restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, \nobservational  data  provide  primary  evidence  for  research  questions \nwhen a randomized trial cannot be performed. For example, it would \nbe  difficult  to  randomize  patients  to  test  diagnostic  or  therapeutic \nstrategies  that  are  unproven  but  widely  accepted  in  practice,  and  it \nwould  be  unethical  to  randomize  based  on  sex,  racial/ethnic  group, \nsocioeconomic status, or country of residence or to randomize patients \nto a potentially harmful intervention, such as smoking or deliberately \novereating to develop obesity.\n\nA well-done prospective observational study of a particular manage-\nment strategy differs from a well-done randomized clinical trial most \nimportantly  by  its  lack  of  protection  from  treatment  selection  bias. \nThe  use  of  observational  data  to  compare  diagnostic  or  therapeutic \nstrategies assumes that sufficient uncertainty and heterogeneity exists \nin  clinical  practice  to  ensure  that  similar  patients  will  be  managed \ndifferently by diverse physicians. In short, the analysis assumes that a \nsufficient element of randomness (in the sense of disorder rather than \nin the formal statistical sense) exists in clinical management. In such \ncases,  statistical  models  attempt  to  adjust  for  important  imbalances \nto \u201clevel the playing field\u201d so that a fair comparison among treatment \noptions can be made. When management is clearly not random (e.g., \nall  eligible  left  main  CAD  patients  are  referred  for  coronary  bypass \nsurgery),  the  problem  may  be  too  confounded  (biased)  for  statistical \ncorrection, and observational data may not provide reliable evidence.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   28\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

For  example,  comparison  of  current  surgical \nmanagement of left main CAD with medically treated patients with left \nmain CAD during the 1970s (the last time these patients were routinely \ntreated with medicine alone) would be extremely misleading because \n\u201cmedical therapy\u201d has substantially improved in the interim.\n\nRandomized controlled clinical trials include the careful prospective \ndesign features of the best observational data studies but also include \nthe  use  of  random  allocation  of  treatment.  This  design  provides  the \nbest protection against measured and unmeasured confounding due to \ntreatment selection bias (a major aspect of internal validity). However, \nthe randomized trial may not have good external validity (generaliz-\nability) if the process of recruitment into the trial resulted in the exclu-\nsion of many potentially eligible subjects or if the nominal eligibility for \nthe trial describes a very heterogeneous population.\n\nConsumers of medical evidence need to be aware that randomized \ntrials  vary  widely  in  their  quality  and  applicability  to  practice.  The \nprocess  of  designing  such  a  trial  often  involves  many  compromises. \nFor example, trials designed to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) approval for an investigational drug or device must fulfill \nregulatory requirements (such as the use of a placebo control) that may \nresult  in  a  trial  population  and  design  that  differ  substantially  from \nwhat practicing clinicians would find most useful.\n\n \u25a0 META-ANALYSIS\nThe Greek prefix meta signifies something at a later or higher stage of \ndevelopment. Meta-analysis is research that combines and summarizes \nthe  available  evidence  quantitatively.  Although  it  is  used  to  examine \nnonrandomized studies, meta-analysis is most useful for summarizing \nall available randomized trials examining a particular therapy used in \na  specific  clinical  context.  Ideally,  unpublished  trials  should  be  iden-\ntified  and  included  to  avoid  publication  bias  (i.e.,  missing  \u201cnegative\u201d \ntrials that may not be published). Furthermore, the best meta-analyses \nobtain and analyze individual patient-level data from all trials rather \nthan using only the summary data from published reports. Nonethe-\nless, not all published meta-analyses yield reliable evidence for a par-\nticular problem, so their methodology should be scrutinized carefully \nto ensure proper study design and analysis. The results of a well-done \nmeta-analysis are likely to be most persuasive if they include at least \nseveral  large-scale,  properly  performed  randomized  trials.  Meta- \nanalysis can especially help detect benefits when individual trials are \ninadequately powered (e.g., the benefits of streptokinase thrombolytic \ntherapy in acute MI demonstrated by ISIS-2 in 1988 were evident by \nthe early 1970s through meta-analysis). However, in cases in which the \navailable trials are small or poorly done, meta-analysis should not be \nviewed as a remedy for deficiencies in primary trial data or trial design.\nMeta-analyses  typically  focus  on  summary  measures  of  relative \ntreatment benefit, such as odds ratios or relative risks. Clinicians should \nalso examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be expected from \nthe  therapy.  A  metric  of  absolute  treatment  benefit  that  is  frequently \nreported is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse \noutcome  event  (e.g.,  death,  stroke).  NNT  should  not  be  interpreted \nliterally  as  a  causal  statement.  NNT  is  simply  1/ARR.  For  example,  if \na hypothetical therapy reduced mortality rates over a 5-year follow-up \nby 33% (the relative treatment benefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% \n(treatment arm), the ARR would be 12% \u2013 8% = 4% and the NNT would \nbe 1/.04, or 25. This does not mean literally that 1 patient benefits and \n24 do not. However, it can be conceptualized as an informal measure \nof treatment efficiency. If the hypothetical treatment was applied to a \nlower-risk population, say, with a 6% 5-year mortality, the 33% relative \ntreatment  benefit  would  reduce  absolute  mortality  by  2%  (from  6% \nto 4%), and the NNT for the same therapy in this lower-risk group of \npatients would be 50. Although not always made explicit, comparisons \nof NNT estimates from different studies should account for the duration \nof follow-up used to create each estimate. In addition, the NNT con-\ncept assumes a homogeneity in response to treatment that may not be \naccurate. The NNT is simply another way of summarizing the absolute \ntreatment difference and does not provide any unique information.\n\n \u25a0 CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nPer the 1990 Institute of Medicine definition, clinical practice guide-\nlines  are  \u201csystematically  developed  statements  to  assist  practitioner \nand patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical \ncircumstances.\u201d This definition emphasizes several crucial features of \nmodern guideline development. First, guidelines are created by using \nthe tools of EBM. In particular, the core of the development process is \na systematic literature search followed by a review of the relevant peer- \nreviewed literature. Second, guidelines usually are focused on a clinical \ndisorder (e.g., diabetes mellitus, stable angina pectoris) or a health care \nintervention  (e.g.,  cancer  screening).  Third,  the  primary  objective  of \nguidelines is to improve the quality of medical care by identifying care \npractices that should be routinely implemented, based on high-quality \nevidence and high benefit-to-harm ratios for the interventions. Guide-\nlines are intended to \u201cassist\u201d decision-making, not to define explicitly \nwhat decisions should be made in a particular situation, in part because \nguideline-level evidence alone is never sufficient for clinical decision-\nmaking (e.g., deciding whether to intubate and administer antibiotics \nfor  pneumonia  in  a  terminally  ill  individual,  in  an  individual  with \ndementia, or in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old mother).\n\nGuidelines  are  narrative  documents  constructed  by  expert  panels \nwhose  composition  often  is  determined  by  interested  professional \norganizations.  These  panels  vary  in  expertise  and  in  the  degree  to \nwhich  they  represent  all  relevant  stakeholders.  The  guideline  docu-\nments consist of a series of specific management recommendations, a \nsummary indication of the quantity and quality of evidence supporting \neach recommendation, an assessment of the benefit-to-harm ratio for \nthe recommendation, and a narrative discussion of the recommenda-\ntions. Many recommendations simply reflect the expert consensus of \nthe  guideline  panel  because  literature-based  evidence  is  insufficient \nor absent. A recent examination of this issue in cardiovascular guide-\nlines  showed  that  <15%  of  guideline  recommendations  were  based \non the highest level of clinical trial evidence, and this proportion had \nnot improved in 10 years despite a substantial number of trials being \nconducted  and  published.  The  final  step  in  guideline  construction  is \npeer  review,  followed  by  a  final  revision  in  response  to  the  critiques \nprovided.\n\nGuidelines are closely tied to the process of quality improvement in \nmedicine through their identification of evidence-based best practices. \nSuch practices can be used as quality indicators. Examples include the \nproportion of acute MI patients who receive aspirin upon admission to \na hospital and the proportion of heart failure patients with a depressed \nejection fraction treated with an ACE inhibitor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThirty years after the introduction of the EBM movement, it is tempt-\ning to think that all the difficult decisions practitioners face have been \nor soon will be solved and digested into practice guidelines and com-\nputerized  reminders.  However,  EBM  provides  practitioners  with  an \nideal rather than a finished set of tools with which to manage patients. \nMoreover,  even  with  such  evidence,  it  is  always  worth  remembering \nthat  the  response  to  therapy  of  the  \u201caverage\u201d  patient  represented  by \nthe summary clinical trial outcomes may not be what can be expected \nfor  the  specific  patient  sitting  in  front  of  a  provider  in  the  clinic  or \nhospital.  In  addition,  meta-analyses  cannot  generate  evidence  when \nthere are no adequate randomized trials, and most of what clinicians \nconfront in practice will never be thoroughly tested in a randomized \ntrial. For the foreseeable future, excellent clinical reasoning skills and \nexperience  supplemented  by  well-designed  quantitative  tools  and  a \nkeen appreciation for the role of individual patient preferences in their \nhealth care will continue to be of paramount importance in the practice \nof clinical medicine.\n\n \u25a0 FURTHER READING\nCroskerry P: A universal model of diagnostic reasoning.

In this rubric, the definition of any disease \nis  largely  based  on  clinicopathologic  observation.  As  the  correlation \nbetween  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  with  pathoanatomy  required \nautopsy material, diseases tended to be characterized by the end organ \nin which the primary syndrome was manifest and by late-stage presen-\ntations. Morgagni institutionalized this framework with the publication \nof De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis in 1761, in \nwhich he correlated the clinical features of patients with more than 600 \nautopsies at the University of Padua, demonstrating an anatomic basis \nfor  disease  pathophysiology.  Clinicopathologic  observation  served  as \nthe basis for inductive generalization coupled with the application of \nOccam\u2019s razor in which disease complexity was reduced to its simplest \npossible form. While this approach to defining human disease has held \nsway for over a century and facilitated the conquest of many diseases \npreviously considered incurable, overly inclusive and simplified Osle-\nrian  diagnostics  suffer  from  significant  shortcomings.  These  include, \nbut are not limited to, failure to distinguish the underlying etiology of \ndifferent diseases with common pathophenotypes. For example, many \ndifferent diseases can cause end-stage kidney disease or heart failure. \nOver  time,  the  classification  of  neurodegenerative  disorders  or  lym-\nphomas, as well as many other diseases, is becoming more refined and \nprecise  as  the  underlying  etiologies  are  identified.  These  distinctions \nare  important  for  providing  predictable  prognostic  information  for \nindividual  patients  with  even  highly  prevalent  diseases.  Additionally, \ntherapies  may  be  ineffective  owing  to  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the \noften subtle molecular complexities of specific disease drivers.\n\nBeginning in the mid-twentieth century, the era of molecular med-\nicine  offered  the  idealized  possibility  of  identifying  the  underlying \nmolecular  basis  of  every  disease.  Using  a  conventional  reductionist \nparadigm,  physician-scientists  explored  disease  mechanism  at  ever- \nincreasing molecular depth, seeking the single (or limited number of) \nmolecular  cause(s)  of  many  human  diseases.  Yet,  as  effective  as  this \nnow conventional scientific approach was at uncovering many disease \nmechanisms,  the  clinical  manifestations  of  very  few  diseases  could  be \nexplained on the basis of a single molecular mechanism. Even knowl-\nedge of the globin \u03b2 chain mutation that causes sickle cell disease does \nnot predict the many different manifestations of the disease (stroke syn-\ndrome, painful crises, and hemolytic crisis, among others). Clearly, the \nprofession  had  expected  too  much  from  oversimplified  reductionism \nand failed to take into consideration the extraordinary biologic variety \nand  its  accompanying  molecular  and  genetic  complexity  that  under-\npin both normal and pathologic diversity. The promise of the Human \nGenome  Project  provided  new  tools  and  approaches  and  unleashed \nefforts to identify a monogenic, oligogenic, or polygenic cause for every \ndisease  (allowing  for  environmental  modulation).  Yet,  once  again, \ndisappointment reigned as the pool of genomes expanded without the \nexpected revelations (aside from rare variants). The arc of progressive \nreductionism (as illustrated for tuberculosis in Fig. 5-1) in refining and \nexplaining disease reached a humbling plateau, revealing the need for \nnew  approaches  to  understand  better  the  etiology, manifestations, and \nprogression  of  most  diseases.  The  stage  was  set  for  a  return  to  holism. \nHowever, in contrast to the holism of ancient physicians, we adopted one \nthat is integrative, taking genomic context into account in all dimensions. \nIn  the  course  of  elaborating  this  complex  pathobiologic  landscape, \ndisease  definition  must  become  more  precise  and  progressively  more \nindividualized, setting the stage for what we term precision medicine.\n\nOversimplification of phenotype is a natural outgrowth of the obser-\nvational  scientific  method.  Categorizing  individuals  as  falling  into \ngroups or clusters that are reasonably similar simplifies the task of the \ndiagnostician and also facilitates the application of \u201cspecific\u201d therapies \nmore  broadly.  Biomedicine  has  been  viewed  as  less  quantitative  and \nprecise  than  other  scientific  disciplines,  with  biologic  and  pathobio-\nlogic diversity (biologic \u201cnoise\u201d) viewed as the norm. Thus, distilling \nsuch  observational  complexity  to  a  fundamental  group  of  symptoms \nor signs that are reasonably invariant across a group of sick individuals \nhas  served  as  the  basis  for  the  approach  to  disease  and  its  treatment \nsince  the  earliest  days  of  medicine.  This  approach  to  diagnosis  and \ntherapy  has  remained  in  place  into  the  twenty-first  century,  serving \nas  the  basis  for  the  development  of  standard  diagnostic  tests  and  of \nbroadly  applied  drug  therapies.  Targeting  larger  groups  of  patients \nis  efficient  when  applied  to  large  populations.  As  successful  as  this \napproach has been in advancing medical care, it is important to point \nout  its  limitations,  which  include  significant  predictive  inaccuracies \nand sizeable segments of the disease population who do not respond to \nthe most \u201ceffective\u201d drugs (upward of 60% by some estimates). Clearly, \na  more  nuanced  approach  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  is  required  to \nachieve better prognostic and therapeutic outcomes.\n\nTurning  first  to  phenotype,  astute  clinicians  know  full  well  the  sub-\ntle  and  vivid  differences  in  presentation  that  are  often  manifest  among \nindividuals  with  the  same  disease.  In  some  cases,  these  differences  in \npathophenotype lead to new subclassifications of the disease, such as heart \nfailure with preserved ejection fraction versus heart failure with reduced \nejection fraction. Often, these relatively crude efforts at making diagnoses \nmore  precise  are  driven  by  new  technologies  or  new  ways  of  applying \nestablished  technologies.  In  other  cases,  differences  in  pathophenotype \nare more subtle, not necessarily clinically apparent, and often driven by \nmeasures of endophenotype, such as distinctions among vasculitides facil-\nitated by refinements in serologies or immunophenotyping. The impetus \nto create these subclasses of disease is largely determined by the need to \nimprove prognosis and apply more precise and effective therapies. Based \non these guiding principles, many experienced clinicians will argue\u2014and \nrightly  so\u2014that  they  have  been  practicing  personalized,  precision  med-\nicine  throughout  their  careers:  they  characterize  each  patient\u2019s  illness  in \ngreat detail, and choose therapies that respect and are guided by those indi-\nvidualized clinical and laboratory features, limited though they may be.\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   30\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

Reprinted with permission from Massachusetts Medical Society.)\n\nFor many diseases, genomic variation, whether inherited or acquired, \nprovides opportunities to refine diagnostic precision with even greater \nfidelity  and  predictive  accuracy.  For  this  reason,  the  field  of  preci-\nsion medicine has now entered a new era that couples the molecular \nreductionism  of  the  last  century  with  an  integrative,  systems-level \nunderstanding  of  the  basis  for  pathophenotype.  Equally  important, \nmodern  genomics  has  established  that  genomic  context,  sometimes \nreferred to as modifier genes, is distinctive for each individual person; \nhence,  understanding  that  context  provides  the  insight  necessary  to \npredict how a primary disease driver or drivers may manifest a clinical  \npathophenotype\u2014e.g.,  why  some  individuals  with  sickle  cell  anemia \nwill  develop  stroke,  while  others  will  develop  acute  chest  syndrome. \nThis  concept  that  primary  genetic  and/or  environmental  drivers  of  a \ndisease  differentially  affect  disease  expression  based  on  an  individual\u2019s \nunique genomic context serves as the ultimate basis for much of what we \ndenote as precision medicine.\n\nTo develop a precision medicine strategy for any disease, the clini-\ncian needs to be aware of two important, confounding principles. First, \npatients with different diseases can manifest similar pathophenotypes, \ni.e.,  convergent  phenotypes.  Examples  of  this  principle  include  the \nhypertrophied  myocardium  found  in  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy, \ninfiltrative  cardiomyopathies,  critical  aortic  stenosis,  and  untreated, \nlong-standing  hypertension;  and  the  thrombotic  microangiopathy \nfound  in  malignant  hypertension,  scleroderma  renal  crisis,  throm-\nbotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  eclampsia,  and  antiphospholipid \nsyndrome. Second, patients with the same basic disease can manifest \nvery different pathophenotypes, i.e., divergent phenotypes (Chap. 466). \nExamples of this principle include the different clinical manifestations \nof cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease and the incomplete penetrance of \n\nmany common genetic diseases. These common presentations of dif-\nferent diseases and different presentations of the same disease are both \na consequence of genomic context coupled with unique exposures over \nan individual\u2019s lifetime (Fig. 5-2). Understanding the interplay among \nthese many complex molecular determinants of disease expression is \nessential for the success of precision medicine.\n\nGiven the complexity of the genomic and environmental context of \nan individual, one must ask the question: How precise do we need to \nbe in order to practice effective precision medicine? Complete knowl-\nedge  of  a  person\u2019s  comprehensive  genome  (DNA,  gene  expression, \nmitochondrial  function,  proteome,  metabolome,  posttranslational \nmodification  of  the  proteome,  and  metagenome,  among  others)  and \nquantitative  assessments  of  environmental  and  social  history  are  not \npossible to acquire; yet, this shortcoming does not render the general \nproblem  intractable.  Owing  to  the  fact  that  the  molecular  networks \nthat  govern  phenotype  are  overdetermined  (i.e.,  redundant)  and  that \nthere are primary drivers of disease expression that are modified in a \nweighted way by other genomic features of an individual, the practice \nof  precision  medicine  can  be  realized  without  complete  knowledge \nof all dimensions of the genome. Examples of how best to realize this \nstrategy are discussed later in this chapter.\n\n \u25a0 REQUIREMENTS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE\nThe  essential  elements  of  any  precision  medicine  effort  include  phe-\nnotyping,  endophenotyping  (defining  the  characteristics  of  a  disorder \nthat are not readily observable), and genomic profiling (Fig. 5-3). While \nsubtle  distinctions  among  individuals  with  the  same  disease  are  well \nknown  to  clinicians,  formalizing  these  nuanced  differences  is  critical \nfor  achieving  more  precise  phenotypes.  Deep  phenotyping  requires  a \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   31\n\n19/01/22   1:49 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Importantly,  these  objective  laboratory  tests \ntogether with functional studies compose an assessment of \nthe  endophenotype  (or  endotype)  of  an  individual,  refin-\ning the overall discriminant power of the evaluation. One \nadditional concept that has gained traction in recent years \nis the notion of orthogonal phenotyping, i.e., assessing clin-\nical, molecular, imaging, or functional (endo)phenotypes \nseemingly  unrelated  to  the  clinical  presentation.  These \nfeatures  further  enhance  the  ability  to  distinguish  (sub)\nphenotypes  and  derive  from  the  fact  that  diseases  can  be \nsubtly  (subclinically)  manifest  in  organ  systems  different \nfrom  that  in  which  the  primary  symptoms  or  signs  are \nexpressed.  While  some  diseases  are  well  known  to  affect \nmultiple organ systems (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) \nand  in  many  cases  involvement  of  those  many  systems  is \nassessed  at  initial  diagnosis,  such  is  not  the  case  for  most \nother  diseases.  As  we  begin  to  understand  the  differ-\nences in the organ-specific expression of genomic variants \nthat  drive  or  modify  disease,  it  is  becoming  increasingly \napparent that orthogonal\u2014or more appropriately, unbiased  \ncomprehensive\u2014phenotyping should become the norm.\n\nGenomic  profiling  must  next  be  coupled  to  detailed \nphenotyping.  The  complex  levels  of  genomic  assess-\nment  continue  to  mature  and  include  DNA  sequencing \n(exomic,  whole  genome),  gene  expression  (mRNA  and \nprotein  expression),  and  metabolomics.  In  addition,  the \nepigenome,  the  posttranslationally  modified  proteome, \nand  the  metagenome  (the  personal  microbiome  of  an \nindividual)  are  gaining  traction  as  additional  elements \nof comprehensive genomics (Chap. 483). Not all of these \ngenomic  features  are  yet  available  for  clinical  laboratory \ntesting,  and  those  that  are  available  are  largely  confined \nto  blood  testing.

As tissue specimens cannot always or easily be obtained from the \norgan of interest, attempts at correlating whole-blood mRNA, protein, \nor metabolite profiles with those of the involved organ are critical for \nprecise  prognostics  and  therapeutic  choices.  In  many  cases,  systemic \nconsequences to an organ-specific disease (e.g., systemic inflammatory \nresponses in individuals with atherosclerosis) can be ascertained and \nmay  provide  useful  prognostic  information  or  therapeutic  strategies. \nThese biomarker signatures are the subject of ongoing discovery and \nhave provided useful guidance toward improved diagnostic precision \nin many diseases. However, in many diseases, the correlations between \nthese  plasma  or  blood  markers  and  organ-based  diseases  are  weak, \nindicating a need to analyze each condition and each resulting signa-\nture before applying it to clinical decision-making. It is important to \nnote that one of the key determinants of the functional consequences \nof a genetic variant believed to drive a disease phenotype is not simply \nits expression in a tissue of interest but, more importantly, the coex-\npression  of  protein  binding  partners  in  that  same  tissue  comprising \nspecific (dys)functional pathways that govern phenotype (Fig. 5-4). An \nalternative strategy currently under investigation is the conversion of \ninduced pluripotent stem cells from a patient into a cell type of interest \nfor gene expression or metabolomics study. As rational as this approach \nseems from first principles, it is important to note that gene expression \npatterns in these induced, differentiated cell types are not completely \nconsonant with their native counterparts, offering often limited addi-\ntional information at potentially great additional expense.\n\nWhile phenotype features of many chronic diseases are assessed over \ntime, genomic features tend to be limited to single time point sampling. \nTime trajectories are extremely informative in precision genotyping and \nphenotyping, with gene expression patterns and phenotypes changing \nover  time  in  different  ways  among  different  patients  with  the  same \noverarching  phenotype.  Cost,  feasible  sampling  frequency,  predictive \npower, and therapeutic choices will all drive the optimal strategy for the \nacquisition of timed samples in any given patient; however, with con-\ntinued cost reduction in genomics technologies, this limitation may be \nprogressively mitigated and clinical application may become a reality.\n\nOne  important  class  of  diseases  that  does  not  have  most  of  these \nlimitations  in  genomic  profiling  is  cancer.  Cancers  can  be  (and  are) \nsampled  (biopsied)  frequently  to  monitor  temporal  changes  in  the \nsomatically  mutating  oncogenome  and  its  consequences  for  the  lim-\nited  number  of  well-defined  oncogenic  driver  pathways  (Chap.  68). \nA  unique  limitation  of  cancer  in  this  regard,  however,  is  that  the \nfrequency of somatic mutations over time (and, especially, with treat-\nment) is great and the functional consequences of many of these muta-\ntions  unknown.  Equally  important,  assessment  of  single-cell  mRNA \nsequencing patterns demonstrates great variability between apparently \nsimilar  cells,  challenging  functional  interpretation.  Lastly,  in  solid \ntumors, stromal cells interact in a variety of ways (e.g., metabolically) \nwith  the  associated  malignant  cells,  and  their  gene  expression  signa-\ntures are also modified by the changing somatic mutational landscape \nof the primary malignancy. Thus, while much more information can be \nobtained over time in most cancer patients, the interpretation of these \nrich data sets continues to remain largely semi-empirical.\n\nThe possibility of identifying specific therapeutic targets remains a \nmajor  goal  of  precision  medicine.  Doing  so  requires  more  than  sim-\nple DNA sequencing and must include analysis of some level of gene \nexpression, ideally in the involved organ(s). In addition to demonstrat-\ning the expression of a variant protein in the organ, one must ideally \nalso  demonstrate  its  functional  consequences,  which  requires  ascer-\ntaining the expression of binding partner proteins and the functional \npathways they comprise. To achieve this goal, a variety of approaches \nhave been tried, one of the most successful of which is the construction \nof the protein-protein interactome (the interactome), which is a com-\nprehensive network map of the protein-protein interactions in a cell or \norgan of interest (Chap. 486). This template provides information on \nthe  subnetworks  that  govern  a  disease  phenotype  (disease  modules), \nwhich can be further individualized by incorporating individual vari-\nants and differentially expressed proteins that are patient specific. This \ntype of analysis leads to the creation of an individual \u201creticulome\u201d or \n\nreticulotype, which links the genotype to the phenotype of an individual \n(Fig. 5-5). Using this approach, one can identify potential drug targets \nin a rational way or can even repurpose existing drugs by demonstrat-\ning the proximity of a known drug target to a disease module of interest \n(Fig. 5-6). For example, in multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease, a disorder \nof unclear etiology, recognition that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is \nhighly activated led to trials with an existing, approved drug, sirolimus. \nPrecision medicine offers additional opportunities for optimizing the \nutilization of a drug by assessing the individualized pharmacogenom-\nics of its disposition and metabolism, as demonstrated for the adverse \nconsequences of variants in TPMT on azathioprine metabolism and in \nCYP2C19 on clopidogrel metabolism (Chap. 68).\n\n \u25a0 EXAMPLES OF PRECISION MEDICINE \nAPPLICATIONS\nThe  field  of  precision  medicine  did  not  appear  abruptly  in  medical \nhistory but, rather, evolved gradually as clinicians became more aware \nof differences among patients with the same disease. With the advent \nof modern genomics, in the ideal situation, these phenotype differences \ncan  now  be  mapped  to  genotype  differences.  Thus,  we  can  consider \nprecision medicine from the perspective of the pregenomic era and the \npostgenomic era. Pregenomic precision medicine was applied to many \ndiseases as therapeutic classes expanded for those disorders. A prime \nexample of this approach is in the field of heart failure, where diuretics, \ndigoxin, beta blockers, afterload-reducing agents, venodilators, renin- \nangiotensin-aldosterone  inhibitors,  and  brain  natriuretic  peptide \n(nesiritide) are commonly used in some combination for most patients. \nThe  choice  of  agents  is  governed  by  the  evidence  basis  for  their  use, \nbut tailored to the primary pathophysiologic phenotypes manifest in a \npatient, such as congestion, hypertension, and impaired contractility. \nThese treatments were developed in the latter half of the last century \nbased  on  empiric  observation,  reductionist  experiments  of  specific \npathways believed to be involved in the pathophysiology, and clinical \nresponse  in  prospective  trials.  As  phenotyping  became  more  refined \n(e.g., echocardiographic assessments of ventricular function and tissue \nDoppler characterization of ventricular relaxation), the syndrome was \nsubclassified into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart \nfailure  with  preserved  ejection  fraction,  the  latter  of  which  does  not \nrespond well to any of the classes of therapeutic agents currently avail-\nable. In the postgenomic era, ever more refined and detailed methods \nare  under  investigation  to  characterize  pathophenotypes  as  well  as \ngenotypes, which may then be matched to the idealized combination \nof therapeutic classes of agents.\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension is another disease for which defin-\nitive  therapies  straddle  the  pre-  and  postgenomic  eras  of  precision \nmedicine.  Prior  to  the  1990s,  there  were  no  effective  therapies  for  this \nhighly morbid and lethal condition. With the advent of molecular and \nbiochemical  characterization  of  vascular  abnormalities  in  individuals \nwith  established  disease,  however,  therapies  with  agents  that  restored \nnormal  vascular  function  improved  morbidity  and  mortality.  These \nincluded  calcium  channel  blockers,  prostacyclin  congeners,  and  endo-\nthelin  receptor  antagonists.  As  genomic  characterization  of  the  disease \nhas progressed over the past two decades, there is increasing recognition \nof distinct genotypes that yield unique phenotypes (Chap. 283), such as \nthe demonstration of a primarily fibrotic endophenotype governed by \nthe (oxidized) scaffold protein NEDD-9 and its aldosterone-dependent, \nTGF-\u03b2-independent  enhancement  of  collagen  III  expression.  This \napproach  will  continue  to  evolve  as  therapies  become  more  effective \n(e.g.,  for  perivascular  fibrosis)  and  therapeutic  choices  better  targeted \nto individual patients.\n\nPrecision genomics has also led to a new classification of the demen-\ntias, conditions previously thought to have a single cause with varied \nclinical expression. These disorders can now be categorized based on \nthe genes and pathways involved and the site where aggregated proteins \nfirst  form  and  then  spread  in  the  nervous  system.  For  example,  the \nvaried  clinical  presentations  of  frontotemporal  dementia,  including \nprogressive aphasia, behavioral disturbances, and dementia with amy-\notrophic lateral sclerosis, can now be linked to specific genotypes and \nsusceptible cells (Chap. 432).

Discovery of autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 \n(AQP-4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has allowed \nneuromyelitis  optica,  previously  considered  a  multiple  sclerosis\u2013like \ndisorder, to be classified as a separate entity requiring different treat-\nment  (Chap.  445).  Similarly,  in  myasthenia  gravis,  the  identification \nof  novel  autoantibodies  now  permits  stratification  and  a  more  finely \ntuned precision approach to therapy (Chap. 448).\n\nNetwork-Based Drug Target ID\n\nNetwork-Based Drug Repurposing:\nThe Proximity Hypothesis\n\nPrecision medicine approaches to cancers have, of course, become the \nprime example of the opportunity that this strategy offers.

As cancer genome sequencing evolved, however, it became appar-\nent that there are a limited number of oncogenic pathways (<20) that are \nrepresented in the great majority of malignancies, without regard for the \norgan in which the disease was primarily manifest. These genomic signa-\ntures served as a template for precisely targeted \ntherapies that have led to dramatic changes in \nresponse to treatment, including, for example, \nimatinib (and congeners) for Bcr-Abl tyrosine \nkinase  activity  in  chronic  myelogenous  leu-\nkemia,  erlotinib  for  EGFR-mutant  non-small \ncell  lung  cancers,  and  ibrutinib  for  Bruton \ntyrosine kinase in chronic lymphocytic leuke-\nmia, among many others.\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\nAs exciting as these approaches have been, \nthere  are  at  least  three  primary  challenges \nassociated  with  precision  therapeutics  that \nare unique to cancer: (1) the mutational land-\nscape continues to evolve as the disease pro-\ngresses,  and  therapy  often  (if  not  invariably) \nleads to selection for resistant clones; (2) the \nlikelihood that any cancer can be definitively \ncured by any single agent, no matter its exqui-\nsite  precision,  is  quite  limited,  necessitating \n\nDisease\nmodule\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nDisease module\n\nDrug target\n\nS3\n\nDisease gene\nDrug target\n\nShortest path to the\nclosest disease gene\n\nFIGURE 5-6  Network-based precision drug repurposing.

Despite these serious shortcomings, the application of \nprogressively more refined and precisely targeted therapies used alone \nand  in  combination,  such  as  with  immune  modulators,  continues  to \noffer  great  promise  for  the  treatment  of  these  diseases.  In  some  ways, \nthese approaches in cancer mirror earlier strategies in the treatment of \ninfectious diseases in which the identification of the causative organism \nand its sensitivity to potential antimicrobials allows precision approaches \nto  treatment.  Combinatorial  antimicrobial  treatments  represent  an \neffective  strategy  to  address  acquired  resistance.  These  diagnostic  and \ntherapeutic  strategies  can  be  applied  without  detailed  knowledge  of \npersonalized responses to the infection or treatment (aside from serious \nadverse effects) with good outcomes in most cases. Yet, individuals do \nrespond  differently  to  specific  infections  and  their  treatments,  possi-\nbly  driven  by  different  endophenotypes  (e.g.,  different  inflammatory \nresponses),  suggesting  that  more  precise  knowledge  of  these  precise \nmechanistic  differences  may  yield  improved  prognosis  and  therapeu-\ntic  approaches.  As  with  cancer,  immune  modulation,  particularly  for \nimmune  exhaustion  in  chronic  infections,  represents  a  new  frontier, \nagain amenable to the personalized, precise analyses described above.\n\n \u25a0 THE FUTURE OF PRECISION MEDICINE\nPrecision medicine clearly holds great promise for the future of the prac-\ntice of medicine. For precision medicine to continue to evolve successfully, \nhowever,  several  requirements  will  need  to  be  met.  First,  both  deeply \nrefined personal phenotypic data and genomic data are essential as the \ninformation with which precision analysis is performed. These data sets \nare  quite  large  and  require  sufficient  storage  for  analysis,  especially  for \nindividuals in whom time trajectories are acquired (as should be the case \nfor every person). Equally important, the analytical methods required to \nextract useful information from these data sets are evolving and them-\nselves quite complex. While great progress has been made in genomics \nand biochemical testing, our ability to capture meaningful immunologic \nendophenotypes and environmental exposures is limited by comparison. \nMachine  learning  and  artificial  (auxiliary)  intelligence  methods  will  be \nessential for extracting optimal information from these data sets, which \ninclude not only pathways that can be uniquely targeted therapeutically \nbut also individualized genomic or phenotypic signatures that are highly \npredictive of outcome, with or without therapy. Gathering sufficient infor-\nmation on the \u201cnormal\u201d segments of the population is also required to \nensure appropriate comparison data sets for optimal prediction.\n\nSecond, phenotyping must continue to expand and become dimen-\nsionally richer. The phenotypic features included in this data gathering \nmust  incorporate  not  only  data  relevant  to  the  clinical  presentation \nbut also orthogonal phenotypic data that may yield useful information \non  disease  trajectory  or  preclinical  disease  markers.  Personal  device \ndata, environmental exposure history, social network interactions, and \nhealth  system  data  will  all  be  incorporated  increasingly  in  defining \nphenotype  and  will  require  great  efforts  on  the  part  of  the  medical \ninformatics community to harmonize data sets, standardize data col-\nlection, and optimize/standardize data analysis (Fig. 5-7).\n\nThird, perhaps the greatest challenge to making precision medicine \nthe standard approach to illness will be to determine the minimal data \nset required to predict outcome and response to therapy. Gathering data \nis  comparatively  simple;  however,  analyzing  it  to  eliminate  redundant \ninformation  in  these  overdetermined  biologic  systems,  weighting  the \ndeterminants of an outcome, and using the data as phenomic/genomic \nsignatures that are easier to collect than comprehensive, unbiased data \nsets  are  the  ideal  goals\u2014a  major  challenge,  but  not  insurmountable. \nRapidly  evolving  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  strategies \nwill also be essential for maximal success.\n\nTo return to the question of how precise precision medicine needs to \nbe in order to be useful, please refer to  Fig. 5-8 where the approaches \n\nA\n\nHealth system data\n\n\u2018Omic\u2019 data\n\nExposome/social\ndeterminants\n\nStudy-participant-\ngenerated data\n\nMotivations\nand behaviours\n\nMicrobiome\n\nB\n\nPrecision participant\ndescriptor\n\nC Electronic health-care\nsystem of the future\n\nDynamic phenotype\n\nData curation and\nuser-friendly display\n\nFIGURE 5-7  Big data in precision medicine.

Martin \n\nA  primary  goal  of  health  care  is  to  prevent  disease  or  detect  it  early \nenough that intervention will be more effective. Tremendous progress \nhas been made toward this goal over the past 50 years. Screening tests \nare available for many common diseases and encompass biochemical \n(e.g.,  cholesterol,  glucose),  physiologic  (e.g.,  blood  pressure,  growth \ncurves), radiologic (e.g., mammogram, bone densitometry), and cyto-\nlogic  (e.g.,  Pap  smear)  approaches.  Effective  preventive  interventions \nhave  resulted  in  dramatic  declines  in  mortality  from  many  diseases, \nparticularly  infections.  Preventive  interventions  include  counseling \nabout risk behaviors, vaccinations, medications, and, in some relatively \nuncommon settings, surgery. Preventive services (including screening \ntests, preventive interventions, and counseling) are different than other \nmedical  interventions  because  they  are  proactively  administered  to \nhealthy individuals instead of in response to a symptom, sign, or diag-\nnosis. Thus, the decision to recommend a screening test or preventive \n\n37\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n6\n\nS\nc\nr\ne\ne\nn\ni\nn\ng\na\nn\nd\nP\nr\ne\nv\ne\nn\nt\ni\no\nn\no\nf\n\nD\ni\ns\ne\na\ns\ne\n\nintervention  requires  a  particularly  high  bar  of  evidence  that  testing \nand intervention are both practical and effective.\n\nBecause  population-based  screening  and  prevention  strategies \nmust be extremely low risk to have an acceptable benefit-to-harm \nratio,  the  ability  to  target  individuals  who  are  more  likely  to \ndevelop disease could enable the application of a wider set of potential \napproaches and increase efficiency. Currently, there are many types of \ndata that can predict disease incidence in an asymptomatic individual. \nGermline genomic data have received the most attention to date, at least \nin part because mutations in high-penetrance genes have clear implica-\ntions for preventive care (Chap. 467). Women with mutations in either \nBRCA1  or  BRCA2,  the  two  major  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes \nidentified to date, have a markedly increased risk (five- to twentyfold) of \nbreast and ovarian cancer. Screening and prevention recommendations \ninclude  prophylactic  oophorectomy  and  breast  magnetic  resonance \nimaging (MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm \nfor women at average cancer risk. Some women with BRCA mutations \nopt  for  prophylactic  mastectomy  to  dramatically  reduce  their  breast \ncancer risk. Although the proportion of common disease explained by \nhigh-penetrance  genes  appears  to  be  relatively  small  (5\u201310%  of  most \ndiseases), mutations in rare, moderate-penetrance genes, and variants \nin  low-penetrance  genes,  also  contribute  to  the  prediction  of  disease \nrisk. Most recently, polygenic risk scores combining information about \nvariants  across  hundreds  of  genes  are  being  evaluated  for  identifying \nindividuals at high risk of coronary heart disease and other conditions. \nThe  advent  of  affordable  whole  exome/whole  genome  sequencing  is \nlikely to speed the dissemination of these tests into clinical practice and \nmay transform the delivery of preventive care.\n\nOther forms of \u201comic\u201d data also have the potential to provide impor-\ntant predictive information. Proteomics and metabolomics can provide \ninsight  into  gene  function,  but  it  has  proven  challenging  to  develop \nreliable, predictive measures using these platforms. More recently, it has \nbecome possible to measure the presence of mutations in DNA circulat-\ning in the bloodstream and in stool, with early promising evidence that \nthese assays can be used to detect cancer before existing screening tests.\nIn  addition  to  \u201comic\u201d  data,  imaging  data  are  increasingly  being \nintegrated into risk-stratified prevention approaches as evidence grows \nabout the predictive ability of these data. For example, coronary com-\nputed tomography (CT) scans are used in many preventive cardiology \nprograms  to  inform  decisions  about  beginning  statin  therapy  when \nthere  is  conflicting  or  uncertain  information  from  other  risk  assess-\nment approaches. Of course, these data may also be helpful in predict-\ning the risk of harms from screening or prevention, such as the risk of \na false-positive mammogram.\n\nIn  addition  to  advances  in  risk  prediction,  there  are  several  other \nreasons  that  screening  and  prevention  are  likely  to  gain  importance \nin  medical  care  in  the  near  term.  New  imaging  modalities  are  being \ndeveloped that promise to detect changes at the cellular and subcellular \nlevels, greatly increasing the probability that early detection improves \noutcomes. The rapidly growing understanding of the biologic pathways \nunderlying  initiation  and  progression  of  many  common  diseases  has \nthe potential to transform the development of preventive interventions, \nincluding  chemoprevention.  Furthermore,  screening  and  prevention \noffer the promise of both improving health and sparing the costs of dis-\nease treatment, an issue that will continue to gain importance as long \nas health care costs in the United States remain a concern to patients, \ngovernment agencies, and insurers.\n\nThis chapter will review the basic principles of screening and pre-\nvention  in  the  primary  care  setting.  Recommendations  for  specific \ndisorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are pro-\nvided in the chapters dedicated to those topics.\n\n \u25a0 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SCREENING\nThe  basic  principles  of  screening  populations  for  disease  were  pub-\nlished by the World Health Organization in 1968 (Table 6-1).\n\nIn  general,  screening  is  most  effective  when  applied  to  relatively \ncommon disorders that carry a large disease burden (Table 6-2). The \nfive  leading  causes  of  mortality  in  the  United  States  are  heart  dis-\neases,  malignant  neoplasms,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   37\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Thus, many screening strate-\ngies are targeted at these conditions. From a global health perspective, \nthese conditions are priorities, but malaria, malnutrition, AIDS, tuber-\nculosis, and violence also carry a heavy disease burden (Chap. 472).\n\nHaving an effective treatment for early disease has proven challeng-\ning  for  some  common  diseases.  For  example,  although  Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, there are \nno curative treatments and no evidence that early treatment improves \noutcomes. Lack of facilities for diagnosis and treatment is a particular \nchallenge  for  developing  countries  and  may  change  screening  strate-\ngies, including the development of \u201csee and treat\u201d approaches such as \nthose currently used for cervical cancer screening in some countries. \nA long latent or preclinical phase where early treatment increases the \nchance of cure is a hallmark of many cancers; for example, polypectomy \nprevents progression to colon cancer. Similarly, early identification of \nhypertension  or  hyperlipidemia  allows  therapeutic  interventions  that \nreduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. \nIn contrast, lung cancer screening has historically proven more chal-\nlenging because most tumors are not curable by the time they can be \ndetected on a chest x-ray. However, the length of the preclinical phase \nalso depends on the level of resolution of the screening test, and this \nsituation changed with the development of chest CT. Low-dose chest \nCT scanning can detect tumors earlier and has been demonstrated to \nreduce lung cancer mortality by 20% in individuals who had at least a \n30-pack-year history of smoking. The short interval between the ability \nto detect disease on a screening test and the development of incurable \ndisease also contributes to the limited effectiveness of mammography \nscreening in reducing deaths from some forms of breast cancer. At the \nother end of the spectrum, the early detection of prostate cancer may \nnot lead to a difference in the mortality rate because the disease is often \nindolent and competing morbidities, such as coronary artery disease, \nmay ultimately cause mortality (Chap. 70). This uncertainty about the \nnatural history is also reflected in the controversy about treatment of \nprostate  cancer,  further  contributing  to  the  challenge  of  screening  in \nthis  disease.  Finally,  screening  programs  can  incur  significant  eco-\nnomic  costs  that  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  the  available \nresources and alternative strategies for improving health outcomes.\n \u25a0 METHODS OF MEASURING HEALTH BENEFITS\nBecause  screening  and  preventive  interventions  are  recommended \nto  asymptomatic  individuals,  they  are  held  to  a  high  standard  for \ndemonstrating  a  favorable  risk-benefit  ratio  before  implementation. \nIn general, the principles of evidence-based medicine apply to demon-\nstrating  the  efficacy  of  screening  tests  and  preventive  interventions, \nwhere  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  with  mortality  outcomes \nare the gold standard. However, because RCTs are often not feasible, \n\nTABLE 6-2  Lifetime Cumulative Risk\nBreast cancer for women\nColon cancer\nCervical cancer for womena\nDomestic violence for women\nHip fracture for white women\n\n10%\n6%\n2%\nUp to 15%\n16%\n\naAssuming an unscreened population.\n\nobservational studies, such as case-control designs, have been used to \nassess the effectiveness of some interventions such as colonoscopy for \ncolorectal  cancer  screening.  For  some  strategies,  such  as  Pap  smear \nscreening for cervical cancer, the only data available are ecologic data \ndemonstrating dramatic declines in mortality.\n\nIrrespective  of  the  study  design  used  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of \nscreening,  it  is  critical  that  disease  incidence  or  mortality  is  the  pri-\nmary endpoint rather than length of disease survival. This is important \nbecause lead time bias and length time bias can create the appearance \nof an improvement in disease survival from a screening test when there \nis no actual effect. Lead time bias occurs because screening identifies \na  case  before  it  would  have  presented  clinically,  thereby  creating  the \nperception that a patient lived longer after diagnosis simply by moving \nthe date of diagnosis earlier rather than the date of death later. Length \ntime bias occurs because screening is more likely to identify slowly pro-\ngressive disease than rapidly progressive disease. Thus, within a fixed \nperiod  of  time,  a  screened  population  will  have  a  greater  proportion \nof these slowly progressive cases and will appear to have better disease \nsurvival than an unscreened population.\n\nA  variety  of  endpoints  are  used  to  assess  the  potential  gain  from \n\nscreening and preventive interventions.\n\n1.

The absolute difference in disease incidence or mortality \nbetween a screened and nonscreened group allows the comparison \nof  size  of  the  benefit  across  preventive  services.  A  meta-analysis \nof  Swedish  mammography  trials  (ages  40\u201370)  found  that  ~1.2 \nfewer  women  per  1000  would  die  from  breast  cancer  if  they  were \nscreened  over  a  12-year  period.  By  comparison,  at  least  ~3  lives \nper 1000 would be saved from colon cancer in a population (aged \n50\u201375) screened with annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) over \na 13-year period, and an estimated 20\u201324 lives per 1000 would be \nsaved over the entire 25-year period. Based on this analysis, colon \ncancer  screening  may  actually  save  more  women\u2019s  lives  than  does \nmammography. However, the relative impact of FOBT (30% reduc-\ntion in colon cancer death) is similar to the relative impact of mam-\nmography (14\u201332% reduction in breast cancer death), emphasizing \nthe importance of both relative and absolute comparisons.\n\n2.  The  number  of  subjects  screened  to  prevent  disease  or  death  in  one \nindividual.  The  inverse  of  the  absolute  difference  in  mortality  is \nthe number of subjects who would need to be screened or receive \na  preventive  intervention  to  prevent  one  death.  For  example,  731 \nwomen aged 65\u201369 would need to be screened by dual-energy x-ray \nabsorptiometry (DEXA) (and treated appropriately) to prevent one \nhip fracture from osteoporosis.\n\n3.  Increase  in  average  life  expectancy  for  a  population.  Predicted \nincreases  in  life  expectancy  for  various  screening  and  preventive \ninterventions are listed in Table 6-3. It should be noted, however, that \nthe increase in life expectancy is an average that applies to a popula-\ntion, not to an individual. In reality, the vast majority of the popula-\ntion does not derive any benefit from a screening test. A small subset \nof patients, however, will benefit greatly. For example, Pap smears do \nnot benefit the 98% of women who never develop cancer of the cer-\nvix. However, for the 2% who would have developed cervical cancer, \nPap smears may add as much as 25 years to their lives. Some studies \nsuggest that a 1-month gain of life expectancy is a reasonable goal for \na population-based screening or prevention strategy.\n\nAVERAGE INCREASE\n\nTABLE 6-3  Estimated Average Increase in Life Expectancy for a \nPopulation\nSCREENING OR PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION\nMammography:\n  Women, 40\u201350 years\n  Women, 50\u201370 years\nPap smears, age 18\u201365\nGetting a 35-year-old smoker to quit\nBeginning regular exercise for a 40-year-old man  \n(30 min, 3 times a week)\n\n0\u20135 days\n1 month\n2\u20133 months\n3\u20135 years\n9 months\u20132 years\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   38\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine\u00a0\n"

    "text": " \u25a0 ASSESSING THE HARMS OF SCREENING  \nAND PREVENTION\nJust  as  with  most  aspects  of  medical  care,  screening  and  preventive \ninterventions  also  incur  the  possibility  of  adverse  outcomes.  These \nadverse outcomes include side effects from preventive medications and \nvaccinations,  false-positive  screening  tests,  overdiagnosis  of  disease \nfrom screening tests, anxiety, radiation exposure from some screening \ntests, and discomfort from some interventions and screening tests. The \nrisk of side effects from preventive medications is analogous to the use \nof  medications  in  therapeutic  settings  and  is  considered  in  the  U.S. \nFood  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approval  process.  Side  effects \nfrom  currently  recommended  vaccinations  are  primarily  limited  to \ndiscomfort and minor immune reactions. However, the concern about \nassociations between vaccinations and serious adverse outcomes con-\ntinues to limit the acceptance of many vaccinations despite the lack of \ndata supporting the causal nature of these associations.\n\nThe possibility of a false-positive test occurs with nearly all screen-\ning  tests,  although  the  definition  of  what  constitutes  a  false-positive \nresult  often  varies  across  settings.  For  some  tests  such  as  screening \nmammography and screening chest CT, a false-positive result occurs \nwhen  an  abnormality  is  identified  that  is  not  malignant,  requiring \neither a biopsy diagnosis or short-term follow-up. For other tests such \nas Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the test identifies a \nwide range of potentially premalignant states, only a small percentage \nof which would ever progress to an invasive cancer. This risk is closely \ntied to the risk of overdiagnosis in which the screening test identifies \ndisease  that  would  not  have  presented  clinically  in  the  patient\u2019s  life-\ntime.  Assessing  the  degree  of  overdiagnosis  from  a  screening  test  is \nvery difficult given the need for long-term follow-up of an unscreened \npopulation to determine the true incidence of disease over time. Recent \nestimates suggest that as much as 15\u201340% of breast cancers identified \n\n39\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n6\n\nS\nc\nr\ne\ne\nn\ni\nn\ng\na\nn\nd\nP\nr\ne\nv\ne\nn\nt\ni\no\nn\no\nf\n\nD\ni\ns\ne\na\ns\ne\n\nby mammography screening and 15\u201337% of prostate cancers identified \nby prostate-specific antigen testing may never have presented clinically. \nScreening tests also have the potential to create unwarranted anxiety, \nparticularly  in  conjunction  with  false-positive  findings.  Although \nmultiple  studies  have  documented  increased  anxiety  through  the \nscreening process, there are few data suggesting this anxiety has long-\nterm adverse consequences, including subsequent screening behavior. \nScreening tests that involve radiation (e.g., mammography, chest CT) \nadd to the cumulative radiation exposure for the screened individual. \nThe absolute amount of radiation is very small from any of these tests, \nbut the overall impact of repeated exposure from multiple sources is \nstill  being  determined.  Some  preventive  interventions  (e.g.,  vaccina-\ntions) and screening tests (e.g., mammography) may lead to discomfort \nat the time of administration, but again, there is little evidence of long-\nterm adverse consequences.\n\n \u25a0 WEIGHING THE BENEFITS AND HARMS\nThe  decision  to  implement  a  population-based  screening  and  preven-\ntion  strategy  requires  weighing  the  benefits  and  harms,  including  the \neconomic impact of the strategy. The costs include not only the expense \nof  the  intervention  but  also  time  away  from  work,  downstream  costs \nfrom false-positive results, \u201cincidentalomas\u201d or adverse events, and other \npotential  harms.  Cost-effectiveness  is  typically  assessed  by  calculating \nthe  cost  per  year  of  life  saved,  with  adjustment  for  the  quality  of  life \nimpact of different interventions and disease states (i.e., quality-adjusted \nlife-year).  Typically,  strategies  that  cost  $50,000\u2013100,000  per  quality- \nadjusted year of life saved are considered \u201ccost-effective\u201d (Chap. 4).\n\nThe  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  is  an  indepen-\ndent panel of experts in preventive care that provides evidence-based \nrecommendations for screening and preventive strategies based on an \nassessment of the benefit-to-harm ratio (Tables 6-4 and 6-5).

For example, all advisory groups support \nscreening for hyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer, whereas consensus \nis lower for breast cancer screening among women in their forties and \nfor prostate cancer screening. Because the guidelines are only updated \nperiodically, differences across advisory organizations may also reflect \nthe data that were available when the guideline was issued.\n\nFor many screening tests and preventive interventions, the balance \nof benefits and harms may be uncertain for the average-risk population \nbut more favorable for individuals at higher risk for disease. Although \nage is the most commonly used risk factor for determining screening \nand  prevention  recommendations,  the  USPSTF  also  recommends \nsome screening tests in populations based upon the presence of other \nrisk factors for the disease. In addition, being at increased risk for the \ndisease often supports initiating screening at an earlier age than that \nrecommended  for  the  average-risk  population.  For  example,  when \nthere  is  a  significant  family  history  of  colon  cancer,  it  is  prudent  to \ninitiate screening 10 years before the age at which the youngest family \nmember was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAlthough  informed  consent  is  important  for  all  aspects  of  medical \ncare, shared decision-making may be a particularly important approach \nto decisions about preventive services when the benefit-to-harm ratio is \nuncertain  for  a  specific  population.  For  example,  many  expert  groups, \nincluding  the  American  Cancer  Society,  recommend  an  individual-\nized  discussion  about  prostate  cancer  screening,  because  the  decision- \nmaking process is complex and relies heavily on personal issues. Some \nmen  may  decline  screening,  whereas  others  may  be  more  willing  to \naccept the risks of an early detection strategy. Recent analysis suggests \nthat  many  men  may  be  better  off  not  screening  for  prostate  cancer \nbecause  watchful  waiting  was  the  preferred  strategy  when  quality- \nadjusted life-years were considered. Another example of shared decision-\nmaking  involves  the  choice  of  techniques  for  colon  cancer  screening \n(Chap. 70). In controlled studies, the use of annual FOBT reduces colon \ncancer deaths by 15\u201330%. Flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colon cancer \ndeaths  by  ~40\u201360%.  Colonoscopy  appears  to  offer  a  greater  benefit \nthan  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  with  a  reduction  in  risk  of  ~70%,  but  its \nuse incurs additional costs and risks. These screening procedures have \nnot been compared directly in the same population, but models suggest \nthat appropriate frequencies of each technique may be associated with \nsimilar numbers of lives saved and cost to society per life saved ($10,000\u2013\n25,000). Thus, although one patient may prefer the ease of preparation, \nless time disruption, and the lower risk of flexible sigmoidoscopy, others \nmay prefer the sedation, thoroughness, and time interval of colonoscopy.\n\n \u25a0 COUNSELING ON HEALTHY BEHAVIORS\nIn  considering  the  impact  of  preventive  services,  it  is  important  to \nrecognize that tobacco and alcohol use, diet, and exercise constitute the \n\nvast majority of factors that influence preventable deaths in developed \ncountries.  Perhaps  the  single  greatest  preventive  health  care  measure \nis to help patients quit smoking (Chap. 454). However, efforts in these \nareas frequently require behavior changes (e.g., weight loss, exercise) \nor the management of addictive conditions (e.g., tobacco and alcohol \nuse) that are often recalcitrant to intervention. Although these are chal-\nlenging problems, evidence strongly supports the role of counseling by \nhealth care providers (Table 6-6) in effecting health behavior change. \nEducational campaigns, public policy changes, and community-based \ninterventions have also proven to be important parts of a strategy for \naddressing these factors in some settings. Although the USPSTF found \nthat the evidence was conclusive to recommend a relatively small set \nof  counseling  activities,  counseling  in  areas  such  as  physical  activity \nand injury prevention (including seat belts and bicycle and motorcycle \nhelmets) has become a routine part of primary care practice.\n\n \u25a0 IMPLEMENTING DISEASE PREVENTION AND \nSCREENING\nThe  implementation  of  disease  prevention  and  screening  strategies \nin  practice  is  challenging.  A  number  of  techniques  can  assist  physi-\ncians with the delivery of these services. An appropriately configured \nelectronic  health  record  can  provide  reminder  systems  that  make  it \neasier for physicians to track and meet guidelines. Some systems give \npatients secure access to their medical records, providing an additional \nmeans to enhance adherence to routine screening. Systems that provide \nnurses and other staff with standing orders are effective for immuni-\nzations. The USPSTF has developed flow sheets and electronic tools to \nassist  clinicians  (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/ \ninformation-health-professionals). Many of these tools use age catego-\nries to help guide implementation. Age-specific recommendations for \nscreening and counseling are summarized in Table 6-7.\n\nMany  patients  see  a  physician  for  ongoing  care  of  chronic  ill-\nnesses,  and  this  visit  provides  an  opportunity  to  include  a  \u201cmeasure \nof prevention\u201d for other health problems. For example, a patient seen \nfor  management  of  hypertension  or  diabetes  can  have  breast  cancer \n\nTABLE 6-6  Preventive Counseling Recommended by the  \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nTOPIC\nAlcohol and drug use\nGenetic counseling for BRCA1/2 testing among \nwomen at increased risk for deleterious mutations\nNutrition and diet\nSexually transmitted infections\nSun exposure\nTobacco use\n\n332, 333\n136, 202\n61\n454\n\nCHAPTER REFERENCE\n453, 456, 457\n79, 467\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   40\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

Over \nthe  past  several  decades,  however,  there  has  been  structural  conver-\ngence  in  the  technical  characteristics  of  both  funding  arrangements \nand  in  the  associated  delivery  systems,  making  analytic  observations \nabout differences across national systems more difficult.\n\nA second confounding factor has been that former Soviet Bloc coun-\ntries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, \nhave, since 1991, replaced their former Soviet-style Semashko models (a \ntop-down, national government\u2013controlled funding and delivery struc-\nture  with  a  parallel  Communist  Party  administrative  apparatus)  with \nvarious  hybrid  arrangements  built  on  national  government\u2013run  SHI \nfinancing. Distinctions across developed country health systems, espe-\ncially in Europe, have been further compressed by inadequate resources \nin many publicly funded systems in an era of rapid clinical and techno-\nlogical change, triggering increased private sector funding and provision.\nIn  middle-income  developing  countries,  institutional  structures  in \nthe health sector typically reflect the country\u2019s preindependence admin-\nistrative framework. Mexico, for example, has a Spanish-derived config-\nuration with health insurance as part of social insurance for formally \nemployed workers (via Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), supple-\nmented  by  tax-funded  health  services  (Seguro  Popular)  provided  for \nthose with informal employment and all other citizens, as well as a sep-\narate program (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Traba-\njadores del Estado) for public employees. Countries such as India and \nEgypt, reflecting British influence, have predominantly tax-funded and \npublicly operated health systems. China is an exception, with an inter-\nnally generated system that is publicly funded and operated, although \nrecent  Communist  Party  policy  has  been  to  introduce  SHI-based \n\ninsurance  with  individual  medical  savings  accounts  (patterned  after \nSingapore), promote private insurance, and expand private hospitals.\n\nIn lower-income developing countries, health services are typically \nprovided  by  tax-funded  public  institutions,  often  with  considerable \ninadequacies and sometimes with substantial copayments. It is impor-\ntant to note that governmentally organized systems in nearly all devel-\noping  countries,  as  well  as  in  former  Soviet  bloc  countries  and,  to  a \nlesser degree, in tax-funded developed countries, are supplemented to \nvarying extents by a mix of private and/or employer-paid insurers and \nproviders.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the individual patient care system: on the \nfinancing  and  delivery  of  individual  clinical  and  preventive  services. \nThe individual patient care system is composed of the financing and \ndelivery of necessary services to prevent death or serious harm (\u201crule \nof rescue\u201d); to maintain quality of life; and to manage, reduce, and/or \nprevent the burden of illness on individual patients. While the techni-\ncal  dimensions  of  most  clinical  services  are  similar  across  countries, \ntheir organizational, social, and economic characteristics range widely. \nHealth  systems  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries  exhibit \nsubstantial differences, for example, in access to care; in the design and \nreliance  on  quality  assurance  and  provider  payment  mechanisms;  in \nthe relationship of primary care to hospital services; in the coordina-\ntion of health care with home care and nursing home services; in the \ndesign  and  use  of  provider  management  strategies;  in  the  way  phy-\nsicians work and are paid; in the decision-making roles of politically \nelected officials and of national, regional, and municipal governments; \nand in participation of both citizens and patients. These wide-ranging \ninstitutional and organizational characteristics reflect differing country \ncontexts  (geographical,  social,  economic,  and  political),  differences \nin  national  culture  (consisting  of  prioritized  norms  and  values),  and \nsubstantial variation in how health sector institutions are structured.\n \u25a0 FINANCING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CARE \nSERVICES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES\nFunding  for  individual  care  services  in  developed  countries  comes \nfrom  the  particular  national  mix  among  four  possible  sources  of \nrevenue:  national,  regional,  and/or  municipal  taxes;  mandatory  SHI; \nprivate  health  insurance  (including  employer-paid  insurances);  and \nout-of-pocket payments. Most countries have one preponderant payer, \nwhich then defines its funding arrangements and serves to frame the \nstructure of its delivery system as well.\n\nTotal  Health  Expenditures  The  Organization  for  Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) data from 2017 (adjusted for \npurchasing power parities) show that total health care expenditures in \ndeveloped  countries  vary  across  a  considerable  range,  tied  to  health \nsystem structure as well as national history and culture (Table 7-1).\n\nPer  capita  health  expenditure  figures  provide  a  different,  specific \nmeasurement of available funds in a country\u2019s health sector (Table 7-2).\n\nTax-Funded  Systems \nIn  the  United  Kingdom,  79%  of  all  health \ncare funding was furnished through general tax revenues allocated by \nthe national government in its annual budget process (all figures from \nOECD for 2017). In Sweden, all public taxes combined raised 83.7% of \ntotal health care spending. Sweden\u2019s 21 regional-level elected govern-\nments  provide  approximately  70%  of  that  83.7%,  with  the  remaining \n13.7% of total health spending raised by national and municipal taxes. \nIn  Canada,  71%  of  total  health  spending  was  raised  by  tax  revenues, \nwith 66% of that 71% coming from provincial or territorial taxes, while \n5% came from national and local government taxes.\n\nIn most tax-funded countries, a segment of the population also has \nindividual-,  company-,  or  union-purchased  private  complementary \nand/or  supplemental  insurance  coverage.  In  Sweden,  2019  estimates \nare that about 600,000 individuals have private complementary policies \nin a total population of 9 million. In Denmark, 50% of the population \npurchase  supplemental  insurance,  while  30%  have  complementary \ninsurance (often purchased by employers) that pays for private sector \nservices  enabling  them  to  bypass  public  sector  queues.  In  Finland, \nmany  middle-class  families  purchase  separate  private  health  insur-\nance  for  their  children  to  enable  them  to  bypass  long  waiting  times \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   42\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

More  than \n400,000 Finnish children (in a total population of 5 million) have pri-\nvately purchased policies. In England in 2015, individual-, employer-, \nand  union-purchased  private  complementary  insurance  covered  an \nestimated  10.5%  of  the  population,  or  about  6  million  people.  In \nCanada, individuals are not allowed by law to purchase private com-\nplementary  insurance  (except  for  Supreme  Court\u2013ordered  insurance \nfor  three  backlogged  surgical  procedures  in  Quebec  Province\u20142005 \nChaoulli  decision);  however,  approximately  65%  of  the  population \nhave  employer-,  union-,  or  private  group\u2013purchased  supplemental \ninsurance for non\u2013publicly covered services such as outpatient phar-\nmaceutical prescriptions and home care.\n\nSocial  Insurance\u2013Funded  Systems \nIn  Western  Europe,  SHI \nfunds  have  traditionally  been  organized  on  a  private  not-for-profit \nbasis,  but  with  statutory  responsibilities  under  national  law.  When \nformer  Soviet  Bloc  countries  in  Eastern  Europe  regained  their  inde-\npendence in 1991, they returned to pre\u2013World War II SHI models, but \nbecause  there  was  no  remaining  organizational  infrastructure,  these \npost-1991  arrangements  typically  became  a  single  SHI  fund,  run  as \nan arm of the national government. In the United States, the Medicare \nsocial  insurance  system  for  citizens  over  age  65,  enacted  in  1965,  is \norganized as a single fund tied to the national Social Security (public \npension)  Administration,  an  independent  agency  within  the  national \ngovernment, with reimbursement arrangements supervised by the Cen-\nters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) inside the Department \nof Health and Human Services. Medicare covers inpatient hospital care \nplus  limited  post-hospital  nursing  home  services  (Medicare  Part  A). \nSupplemental private insurance policies are bought by covered individ-\nuals to help pay for outpatient physician visits (Medicare Part B) and \nfor outpatient pharmaceuticals (Medicare Part D).\n\nIn Germany, 85% of the population is enrolled in one of 120 not-for-\nprofit, monthly premium\u2013based private SHI funds. This figure includes \nall individuals with annual incomes below 54,500 euros, who are required \nby law to join an SHI fund, as well as those with higher incomes who \nchoose to enroll or remain. Eleven percent of the population\u2014all hav-\ning  annual  incomes  above  the  mandatory  SHI  enrollment  ceiling  of \n54,500 euros\u2014have opted out of the SHI system to voluntarily enroll \nin claims-based private health insurance, whereas 4% of the citizenry \nis  enrolled  in  sector-specific  public  programs  such  as  the  military. \nSince 2009, all SHI members pay a flat tax on gross monthly income \nas a contribution (8.2% in 2018, up to an upper income limit of 49,500 \neuros),  which  is  transferred  by  their  SHI  fund  to  a  national  pool, \n\nand  then  redistributed  back  to  their  chosen  fund  on  an  individual \nrisk-adjusted basis. Employers send 7.3% of each employee\u2019s salary to \nthe same national pool. Special arrangements exist for payments from \nself-employed, retired, and unemployed workers. Since 1995, there has \nbeen  a  separate  mandatory  social  insurance  fund  for  long-term  care \n(LTC), with an annual premium of 1.95% of each adult\u2019s gross monthly \nincome,  split  50%\u201350%  with  their  employer.  Pensioners  since  2004 \nare required to pay the full 1.95% from their pensions. Childless SHI \nenrollees pay a surcharge of 0.25% of monthly gross income. Overall, \n78% of all health care expenditures in Germany were paid from public \nand/or mandatory private SHI sources.\n\nIn  the  Netherlands  since  2006,  all  adult  citizens  pay  a  fixed  pre-\nmium  (about  1453  euros  in  2019)  to  their  choice  among  35  pri-\nvate  health  insurers  (not-for-profit  and  for-profit),  with  four  large \ninsurance  groups  having  over  1  million  members  each.  In  addition, \nemployers pay 6.95% of salary below 51,400 euros for each employee \ninto  a  national  health  insurance  fund.  Self-employed  individuals  pay \n4.85% into the national fund for taxable income up to the same limit. \nRetired and unemployed individuals also make payments. In addition \nto  the  individual  premiums  paid  to  their  choice  of  private  insurance \nfund, payments from the national health insurance fund, adjusted by \nindividual  age,  sex,  and  health  characteristics,  also  are  made  to  the \nindividual\u2019s chosen insurer. The Netherlands has a separate mandatory \nsocial insurance fund for LTC (the ABWZ, since 2015 the WLZ, and \nnow only for residential nursing home care) to which each employee \npays  9.5%  of  taxable  income  beneath  33,600  euros  every  year.  Self- \nemployed, unemployed, and retired individuals also are required to pay \npremiums to the WLZ. Overall, including SHI revenues, public spend-\ning provided 87% of total health expenditures in 2014.\n\nIn  Estonia,  a  former  Soviet  Republic  that  re-established  an  SHI \nsystem in 1991 upon regaining its independence, there is one national \nSHI fund that is an arm of the national government. This fund collects \nmandatory  payments  of  13%  from  salaried  workers  and  20%  from \nself-employed  individuals,  covering  both  health  care  and  retirement \npensions. Overall, including SHI revenues, public spending accounted \nfor 74.5% of total health expenditures in 2017.\n\nSingapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have predominantly SHI \nsystems of funding for individual care services. In these Asian coun-\ntries (except Japan), there is one SHI fund that typically is operated as \nan arm of the national government.\n\nIn Singapore, starting in 1983, all employees up to age 50 have been \nrequired to place 20% of their income (employers add 16% more) into \na  personal  health  savings  account  to  pay  for  direct  health  care  costs, \n\nTABLE 7-2  Developed Country Per Capita Health Expenditures\nTAX FUNDED IN WESTERN \nEUROPE\n\nSHI FUNDED IN WESTERN \nEUROPE\n\nSpain\nItaly\nUK\nDenmark\nSweden\n\n$2738\n$2738\n$3958\n$5565\n$5710\n\nBelgium\nGermany\nNetherlands\nSwitzerland\n\n$4149\n$4714\n$4742\n$9835\n\nAbbreviations: SHI, social health insurance; UK, United Kingdom.\n\nCENTRAL EUROPEAN\n$874\n$809\n$1321\n$1834\n\nLatvia\nPoland\nCzech Republic\nSlovenia\n\nDEVELOPED ASIAN\n$2043\n$4083\n$4233\n\nSouth Korea\nSingapore\nJapan\n\nDEVELOPED NORTH \nAMERICAN\n\nCanada\nUnited States\n\n$4458\n$9869\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   43\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

Medisave accounts have a maximum amount, are tax-exempt, \nand  receive  interest  payments  (currently  set  at  4%).  Consistent  with \na  Confucian  emphasis  on  family,  the  funds  that  accumulate  in  the \nMedisave account can be spent on health care for family members as \nwell. If the accumulated funds are not spent on health care during the \ninsured\u2019s life, they become part of the individual\u2019s personal estate and \nare distributed as a tax-free inheritance to his or her designated heirs. \nIn addition, Singaporean citizens are also automatically enrolled into \na  second  government-run  health  insurance  plan  called  MediShield \nthat pays for supplemental catastrophic, chronic, and long-term care. \nWhile  citizens  can  opt  out,  90%  of  citizens  remain  in  the  program. \nThe  Singapore  government  also  operates  a  third,  wholly  tax-funded \npayer  called  Medifund  that,  with  approval  of  a  local  neighborhood \ncommittee, will pay hospital costs for 3\u20134% of the population who are \nrecognized as indigent. In part reflecting the high level of mandatory \nindividual saving, public funding provided only 54.5% of total health \nexpenditures in 2016.\n\nIn  South  Korea,  a  state-run  SHI  system  was  established  in  1977, \nwhich in 1990 covered 30.9% of total health care costs. This percent-\nage paid by the SHI system rose to 40.5% of total costs in 2017, with \nnational tax revenue covering 16.9%, leaving out-of-pocket expenses at \na relatively high 34.4% of total costs. Although there are legal ceilings \non total out-of-pocket copayments for each 6-month period, over 70% \nof  Korean  adults  purchase  an  additional  private  Voluntary  Health \nInsurance policy to cover these additional direct expenditures. In 2000, \nthree  types  of  public  SHI  funds  were  merged  into  a  single  national \nstate-run  fund.  As  of  2018,  6%  of  an  employee\u2019s  salary  must  be  paid \nas a social insurance contribution into this fund, with employees and \nemployers each paying 50% of that amount. In 2008, an additional SHI \nfund was introduced to pay for LTC, operated by the main state-run \nSHI  fund  to  reduce  administrative  costs.  Contributions  to  the  LTC \nfund are set at 6.55% of the individual\u2019s regular SHI contribution, cou-\npled with 20% copayments for institutional care and 15% copayments \nfor home care services.\n\nThe  United  States  There  is  no  single  preponderant  source  of \nhealth  care  spending  in  the  United  States.  The  federal  government\u2019s \nCMS reported that, for 2017, private health insurance covered 34% of \ntotal  health  expenditures,  Medicare  (mandatory  SHI  program  for  all \ncitizens over 65) covered 20%, Medicaid (a joint federal-state welfare \nprogram for low-income citizens) covered 17%, and out-of-pocket paid \n10%. Sources of funds for these programs were 28% from the federal \ngovernment, 17% from state and local governments, 28% from private \nhouseholds,  and  20%  from  private  business  (e.g.,  employers).  The \nWorld Bank set public funding in the United States at 50.2% of total \nhealth expenditures in 2017.\n\nIn  2010,  the  passage  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  extended \nprivately provided but heavily regulated and federally subsidized health \ninsurance to many low- and middle-income uninsured individuals and \nfamilies.  Since  the  same  act  reduced  the  availability  of  existing  indi-\nvidually  purchased  private  health  insurance,  the  total  increase  in  the \nnumber of newly covered individuals was less than expected. Insurance \npremium increases for 2017 rose from 20% to over 100%, depending \non the particular state, with additional increases in up-front deductible \nrequirements,  raising  questions  about  the  long-term  sustainability  of \nthe  ACA  initiative.  The  recent  Republican  administration  sought  to \nrepeal  major  financial  and  tax  elements  of  the  ACA  and  to  replace \nexisting subsidy arrangements with a system of refundable tax credits \ntoward the establishment of individual health savings accounts and/or \npurchase of private health insurance on open cross-state markets (cur-\nrently, private health insurance in the United States remains controlled \nat the separate 50-state level of government).\n\n \u25a0 DELIVERING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CARE \nSERVICES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES\nHospital  Services \nIn  Europe,  hospitals  in  both  tax-funded  and \nSHI-funded  health  systems  are  mostly  publicly  owned  and  operated \nby regional or municipal governments. In tax-funded health systems, \n\nmost hospital-based physicians are civil servants, employed on a nego-\ntiated  salary  basis  (often  by  a  physician  labor  union),  and  subject  to \nmost of the usual advantages and disadvantages of being a public sector \nemployee. There are somewhat more private hospitals in SHI-funded \nhealth systems. However, most larger hospitals are public institutions \noperated by local governments, and most hospital physicians (with the \nnotable exception of the Netherlands, where they are private contrac-\ntors organized in private group practices) are, like those in tax-funded \nsystems, public sector employees. In most tax-funded European coun-\ntries  (but  not  continental  SHI-funded  countries),  few  specialist  phy-\nsicians have office-based practices, and in both tax- and SHI-funded \nsystems,  office-based  specialists  do  not  have  admitting  privileges  to \npublicly operated hospitals.\n\nMost  public  hospitals  in  both  tax-funded  and  SHI-funded  health \nsystems are single free-standing institutions that can be classified into \nthree broad categories by complexity of patients admitted and number \nof specialties available: (1) district hospitals (four specialties: internal \nmedicine,  general  surgery,  obstetrics,  and  psychiatry);  (2)  regional \nhospitals (20 specialties); and (3) university hospitals (>40 specialties). \nIn  addition,  many  countries  have  a  number  of  small,  15-  to  20-bed, \nfreestanding, private (typically for-profit) clinics. Recently, some tax-\nfunded countries have begun to merge district and regional hospitals \nin  an  effort  to  improve  the  quality  of  care  and  create  financial  effi-\nciencies (for example, Norway; planned for Denmark, also for Ireland; \nhowever, failed Parliamentary passage and brought down the coalition \ngovernment, in Finland in 2019). Institutional mergers can be difficult \nto  negotiate  among  publicly  operated  hospitals,  due  to  the  role  that \nthese  large  institutions  play  as  important  care  providers  and  as  large \nemployers  in  smaller  cities  and  towns,  especially  given  political  and \nunion concerns about maintaining current employment levels. In the \nUnited States, financial and reimbursement pressures triggered by the \nimplementation of the 2010 ACA have generated a number of private \nsector hospital mergers into larger hospital groups.\n\nIn  tax-funded  health  systems,  publicly  funded  patients  who  are \nadmitted for an elective procedure cannot choose their specialist phy-\nsician  (except  private-pay  patients  in  \u201cpay  beds\u201d  in  National  Health \nService  [NHS]  hospitals  in  England).  Specialists  are  assigned  by  the \nclinic  to  a  patient  based  on  availability,  with  both  junior  and  senior \ndoctors placed in rotation.\n\nCapital  costs  (buildings,  large  medical  equipment)  are  publicly \nfunded in all tax-funded systems and in most traditional SHI systems. \nFor example, in Germany, capital costs for public hospitals are paid for \nby the regional governments. As a result, new capital investment is often \nallocated  politically,  according  to  location  and  political  priorities.  In \nFinland, local politicians in the 1980s would say that it \u201ctakes 10 years \nto build a hospital,\u201d meaning that it took that long to become a political \npriority  for  the  regional  government  that  controlled  capital  expendi-\ntures. Local politicians would therefore regularly overbuild when they \ngot their one opportunity to obtain new capital.\n\nRecently,  efforts  have  been  made  to  make  public  hospitals  more \nresponsible for their use of capital. In the Netherlands, public hospitals \nwere shifted into private not-for-profit entities that are expected either \nto fund new capital from operating surplus or to borrow the funds from \na bank based on a viable business plan. In England, more than 100 hos-\npitals have been built using the Public Finance Initiative (PFI) program, \nin which private developers build turn-key facilities (thus taking capital \ncosts off the public borrowing limit), and then rent these facilities back \nto the NHS and/or the relevant NHS Foundation Trust. In Sweden and \nFinland, while capital equipment is now a cost on hospital operating \nbudgets, large new capital equipment and major building renovations \nremain  politically  driven  processes  often  with  extensive  delays.  In \nStockholm County, the New Karolinska University Hospital opened in \n2018 was built and is managed by a separate nonprofit public-private \ncompany.\n\nIn Singapore and South Korea, both of which are SHI funded, larger \nhospitals are publicly operated. However, there are a substantial num-\nber of smaller private clinics typically owned by specialist physicians. \nIn  the  United  States,  the  passage  of  the  2010  ACA  has  triggered  the \nselling  of  many  private  specialist  group  practices  to  hospital  groups, \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   44\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

Recent  changes \nin  tax-funded  health  systems  include  Norway,  where  most  primary \ncare moved from municipally employed physicians to private-practice \nGPs in 2003, and Sweden, where, following a 2010 change in national \nreimbursement requirements, new privately owned not-for-profit and \nfor-profit  GP  practices  were  established  and  now  deliver  50%  of  all \nprimary care visits.\n\nIn England, most primary care physicians are private GPs who are \ncontractors  to  the  NHS,  working  either  independently  or  in  small \ngroup practices. These private GPs own their own practices, which they \ncan sell when they retire. However, as part of the original agreement to \nconvince physicians to support the establishment of the NHS in 1948 \n(which most physicians strongly opposed), private GPs also receive a \nnational  government  pension  upon  retirement.  In  the  inner  cities  in \nEngland, there are some larger primary health clinics.\n\nIn 2001, England\u2019s private primary care doctors were organized into \ngeographically  based  Primary  Care  Trusts  (PCTs).  These  PCTs  were \nallocated 80% of the total NHS budget to contract for elective hospital \nservices  required  by  their  patients  with  both  NHS  hospital  trusts  as \nwell as private hospitals. In 2013, PCTs were restructured into Clinical \nCommissioning Groups with similar contracting responsibilities.\n\nIn 2004, the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) was introduced as \na quality of care\u2013tied approach to providing additional income for NHS \nGPs. This regulatory mechanism in 2010 set 134 different standards for \nbest practice primary care in four main domains: 86 clinical, 36 organi-\nzational, 4 preventive service, and 3 patient experience. GP income grew \non average by 25% through the introduction of the QOF, with general \npractices averaging 96% of possible QOF points. Total spending on QOF \nin 2014 in England consumed 15% of all primary care expenditures.\n\nIn  April  2019,  a  slightly  revised  QOF  contract  was  implemented, \nwhich retired 28 low-value indicators, introduced 15 new more clini-\ncally appropriate indicators, added two Quality Improvement modules, \nand  added  a  new  personalized  care  adjustment  option.  Funding  was \nonly changed marginally.\n\nAccess for individuals to primary care services is considered good \nin SHI-funded systems such as those in Germany and the Netherlands. \nOne  often-cited  reason  is  that  private  office-based  physicians  (both \nGPs and specialists) in these countries are paid on a modified fee-for-\nservice basis. In Germany, office-based physicians are paid on a quar-\nterly basis by the Sickness funds, acting jointly at the L\u00e4nder (regional) \nlevel  through  a  point-based  system.  A  national  agreement  between \nthe physician association and the association of sick funds establishes \npoints for each clinical act. Similarly, the association of sick funds (led \nin each of Germany\u2019s 16 L\u00e4nder by the fund with the most subscribers \nin that region) establishes a fixed budget for all office-based physician \nservices for all sick fund patients each 3-month period. Retrospectively \nat the end of each period, the total number of points is divided into the \nsick funds\u2019 fixed allocation for office-based physicians for that L\u00e4nder \nfor that quarter, establishing the value of a point for that quarter. Sub-\nsequently, each office-based physician\u2019s point total is multiplied by that \nquarterly point value, resulting in that physician\u2019s total payment from \nthe statutory sick funds.\n\nIn contrast to SHI systems, seeing a primary care doctor in a number \nof  tax-funded  health  systems  has  become  increasingly  difficult  over \nthe past decade. In Sweden, in 2005, a \u201ccare guarantee\u201d was introduced \nthat required its predominantly publicly operated health centers to see \na  patient  within  7  days  after  calling  for  an  appointment.  In  Finland, \nwhere public primary health care centers used to provide most primary \ncare  visits,  delays  in  getting  public  health  center  appointments  have \npushed up to 40% of all visits into a parallel occupational health sys-\ntem, as well as to publicly employed primary care physicians working \nprivately in the afternoons.\n\nIn England in 2019, access to GP services has been labeled a \u201ccrisis,\u201d \naggravated  by  a  6%  fall  in  the  number  of  practicing  GPs,  leading  to \ndelays of up to 30 days for an appointment in urban areas like London. \nA 2019 report by the King\u2019s Fund found that only 1 in 20 trainee GPs \nplanned to work full time. Also in 2019, the Nuffield Trust published \na  report  suggesting  that  future  planning  for  primary  care  services  in \nEngland should assume a permanent shortage of GPs, requiring large \nnumbers of new nurse practitioners and other auxiliary personnel. In \nCentral European countries that were formerly within the Soviet Bloc, \nprimary care provision had to be newly established after independence \nwas  regained  in  1991,  since  first-line  care  in  the  former  Semashko \nmodel  was  provided  in  specialist  polyclinics.  Primary  care  doctors \nrapidly  emerged  as  almost  entirely  private  for-profit  GPs,  working \non  contract  from  the  national  SHI  fund  (Estonia,  Hungary,  North \nMacedonia), from state-regulated private insurance companies (Czech \nRepublic), or from regional/municipal public payers (Poland). Private \nGPs in most Central European countries now are paid on a per-visit-\ntied  basis.  This  arrangement  was  heavily  influenced  by  the  structure \nof primary care in Germany, where private office-based GPs are paid \naccording to a point-system-tied framework.\n\nIn Asian countries such as Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, most \nprimary  care  is  provided  by  private  for-profit  GPs  working  indepen-\ndently or in small group practices. Private GPs are reimbursed at a set \nper-service  fee  by  the  national  SHI  fund(s).  Access  to  primary  care \nphysicians is considered good.\n\nDeveloped countries have varying policies regarding access to indi-\nvidual  preventive  services.  Health  systems  in  most  countries  provide \nvaccinations and mammography as part of funded health care services. \nIn the United States, most insured individuals\u2014and in Canada, most \ncovered  residents\u2014automatically  receive  an  annual  physical  exam \nincluding full blood profiles. In Norway and Denmark, adult physical \nexams are provided only upon special request by the individual, and in \nSweden, adult physical exams are provided only to pregnant women. In \nSweden, adults who wish to know their cholesterol or prostate-specific \nantigen (PSA) levels have begun to purchase blood tests out-of-pocket \nfrom private laboratories. In England in 2019, the NHS announced it \nwould stop providing PSA screening tests for prostate cancer, even to \nmen who requested one, similarly forcing concerned patients to pur-\nchase private laboratory testing.\n\nPatients  must  make  copayments  to  see  a  primary  care  doctor  in \nsome  tax-funded  health  systems  and  in  most  SHI  countries.  In  tax-\nfunded  systems,  for  example,  Swedish  patients  are  required  to  make \na  county-council-set  copayment  for  each  primary  care  visit  up  to  a \nnational-government-set annual ceiling, after which ambulatory visits \n(both primary and outpatient specialist) are not charged. Finland has \na fixed copay for public health center visits, while Denmark\u2019s private \nGP visits do not have a copayment. In England, there is no copayment \nfor GP visits.\n\nIn SHI health care systems in Europe and in Asia, patients usually \nare  responsible  for  a  copayment  for  both  primary  and  office-based \nspecialist care. To defray these charges (and to pay for other nonfunded \nservices),  a  high  percentage  of  citizens  typically  purchase  additional \nsupplemental  health  insurance.  In  France,  where  95%  of  patients  in \n2015 purchased private supplemental insurance, patients paid directly \nthe full fee for 65% of outpatient primary and specialist services, reim-\nbursed  subsequently  by  both  their  SHI  fund  and  their  supplemental \ninsurance  carrier  for  all  payments  (after  deductibles),  while  for  35% \nof  services  (for  low-income  individuals  and  certain  high-cost  proce-\ndures), full agreed prices were paid directly to providers by SHI.\n\nAccess  to  Elective  Specialist  Care  Approximately  half  of  all \nEuropean health care systems have a gatekeeping system that requires \nreferrals from primary care physicians in order to book hospital spe-\ncialist visits (for publicly paid visits). In most tax-funded health systems \n(although not in most SHI systems), there are substantial waiting times, \ntypically several months or more, for elective specialist appointments \nas well as for high-tech diagnostic and treatment procedures. Waiting \ntimes  can  be  particularly  long  for  cancer  and  other  elective  surgical \nor  high-demand  services.  In  Sweden,  government  figures  from  the \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   45\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

    "text": "46\n\nsummer of 2017 showed that, nationally, only 5\u201310% of prostate cancer \noperations were performed within 60 days after diagnosis.\n\nIn the English NHS, waiting lists for elective surgery in 2019 were \noften 6 months or longer. In August 2017, there were over 4,000,000 \npatients  on  NHS  waiting  lists.  In  January  2018,  what  administrators \ntermed \u201ca severe flu season,\u201d during which hospital emergency rooms \nwere  overwhelmed  with  elderly  patients  requiring  admission,  led  to \na  national-level  NHS  decision  to  cancel  all  elective  operating  room \nprocedures  in  all  hospitals  in  England  (>50,000  procedures  in  1200 \nhospitals) for the entire month of January, further lengthening waiting \nlists. Regarding quality of care, again in England, a March 2018 report \nfrom the national Office of Health Economics found that, in 2016 and \n2017, up to three-quarters of patients who could have undergone key-\nhole procedures were forced to undergo open surgery, resulting in an \nestimated 1 million procedures each year that were more invasive than \nclinically necessary.\n\nDelays in some tax-funded systems also are procedural. In England, \nfor example, a patient who requires a further consultation with a sec-\nond specialist typically has to return to their primary care physician for \na second referral and then has to wait in the regular patient queue for \nthat second appointment.\n\nThere is also substantial waiting time for radiologic imaging services \nin most tax-funded systems. In Malta, the tax-funded health system\u2019s \nrecent efforts to prioritize elective MRI investigations have succeeded \nin  reducing  waiting  times  from  18  months  to  4  months.  In  both  the \nAlberta and British Columbia Provinces in Canada, waiting times for a \npublicly funded nonemergency MRI can extend up to several months, \nwhereas privately paid MRIs were available in both provinces within \n1 week.\n\nThis  issue  of  waiting  times  for  specialist  services  in  tax-funded \nhealth systems reflects a combination of growing demand (increasing/ \naging  populations  and  changing  clinical  indications),  financial  con-\nstraints,  and  insufficient  capacity,  including  inadequate  physician \nworking  hours.  For  example,  in  the  1980s,  when  several  surgical \nprocedures  for  the  elderly  became  more  routine  practice  (e.g.,  hip \nreplacement, coronary artery bypass graft, corneal lens implantation), \nthe  waiting  list  problem  worsened.  It  had  been  mitigated  somewhat \nthrough increased service capacity by the early 2000s, only to return \nas  a  growing  policy  challenge  once  public  sector  financial  resources \nbecame constrained again after the 2008 global financial crisis. Timely \ncancer diagnosis and care continue to be a particularly sensitive issue, \nwith tax-funded systems often taking several months for a patient to \nsee an oncologist and then months more to begin treatment. In 2013 \nin  Sweden,  a  newspaper  journalist  set  off  a  political  storm  when  he \ndescribed women patients in one large county council (Malmo) who \nhad to wait more than 40 days to receive the results from their breast \ncancer biopsy. In September 2019 in England, only 76.9% of patients \nwith suspected cancer began treatment within 2 months of an urgent \nreferral from a GP.\n\nIn response to pressure from national patient associations, a number \nof tax-funded health care systems introduced maximum waiting times \nfor  elective  hospital  procedures  in  the  early  2000s.  (Most  Western \nEuropean  SHI  systems  do  not  have  long  waiting  times  or  treatment \nguarantees for hospital care.) These maximum waiting times typically \ninclude initial primary care visits as well as specialist evaluations and \ntreatment.  In  Denmark,  a  patient  has  the  right  to  go  to  a  different \nDanish public hospital for care after waiting 30 days without treatment. \nIn  Sweden,  under  the  2005  \u201cwaiting  time  guarantee,\u201d  an  untreated \npatient\u2019s  local  county  council  is  required  to  pay  for  care  in  another \ncounty\u2019s hospital after 180 days. In a parallel process at the European \nUnion (EU) level, beginning in 1997, the EU Court of Justice steadily \nexpanded the right of all EU citizens to travel to another EU country in \norder to receive \u201ctimely\u201d care, with their home country health system \nrequired to pay for that care.\n\nIn  private  not-for-profit  SHI-funded  health  systems  such  as  in  \nGermany  and  Switzerland,  waiting  times  for  specialist  visits  and \nhospital procedures are typically a few weeks to 1 month. In the SHI \nsystem in France, which is more centrally organized and funded (part \nof the Napoleonic tradition of public administration), ongoing disputes \n\nabout insufficient central government funding for public hospitals and \nstaff  salaries  led  in  March  2019  to  9  months  of  hospital  staff  strikes, \nparticularly  in  accident  and  emergency  departments.  In  November \n2019,  the  national  government  announced  that  it  would  take  over  \n10 billion euros in public hospital debt as part of an effort to reverse \nstaff cutbacks, bed and operating theater closures, and personnel flight \nto the private sector.\n\nLong-Term  Care  Services  LTC  (consisting  of  residential  and \nhome-based  services)  consumes  a  relatively  small  but  increasing  pro-\nportion  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  developed  countries.  In \n2016, Norway (2.95% GDP), Sweden (2.87% GDP), and the Netherlands \n(2.64% GDP) all spent more than one-fourth of their total health expen-\nditures on LTC (Eurostat and OECD figures). More than one-fifth of all \nhealth care expenditures went to LTC in Belgium (2.16% GDP), Ireland \n(1.55%  GDP),  and  Denmark  (2.5%  GDP).  Lower-spending  countries \nincluded  the  United  Kingdom  (18%  of  health  expenditures;  1.75% \nGDP),  Germany  (12%  of  expenditures;  1.33%  GDP),  and  Spain  (9% \nof expenditures; 0.81% GDP). In the United States, official figures put \ntotal LTC expenditures in 2016 at 4.9% of total health expenditures, or \n0.9% of total GDP. (Note that these figures do not include emergency, \ninpatient, or outpatient hospital costs generated by elderly patients.)\n\nSince nursing home care is more expensive than home care (nursing \nhome  care  requires  the  provision  of  housing,  food,  and  around-the-\nclock  care  providers),  government  policymakers  seek  to  keep  the \nelderly and the chronically ill out of nursing homes for as long as fea-\nsible. Moreover, in developed countries like Sweden, Norway, and the \nUnited States, some 70% of all home care services come from informal \ncaregivers:  spouses,  children  (typically  daughters),  neighbors,  and  \nnonprofit community groups. While some SHI systems (e.g., Germany) \nhave separate public LTC insurance (funded by mandatory premiums \npaid by all adults) that make available cash payments for LTC that can \nbe  used  to  compensate  informal  caregivers,  most  policymakers  work \nhard  to  not  monetize  what  is  a  large  amount  of  essentially  free  care. \nIndeed, policymakers actively seek to encourage those providing these \nservices  to  continue  to  do  so  as  long  as  possible,  trying  to  postpone \ncaregiver  burnout  by  providing  support  services  such  as  free  respite \ncare, special call-in lines for caregiving advice, pension points toward \nretirement for the informal caregiver (Nordic countries), and free day-\ncare center services.\n\nIn most tax-funded and SHI-funded European countries, home care \nservices are organized at the municipal government level. In tax-funded \nsystems, these services are also delivered mostly by municipal employees, \nworking  according  to  union-negotiated  protocols.  In  some  European \nSHI  systems,  and  recently  in  tax-funded  Sweden  and  Finland,  private \ncompanies also provide home care services on contract to municipal \ngovernments.  In  combination  with  national  legislation,  these  munic-\nipal  systems  also  provide  important  support  for  informal  caregivers, \nsince  the  financial  costs  of  caring  for  adults  in  their  own  home  are \nsubstantially less than providing housing, food, and caregiver support \nin publicly funded homes for the aged or in nursing homes.\n\nA high proportion of nursing homes in European tax-funded and \nSHI-funded  health  systems  are  publicly  owned  facilities  operated  by \nmunicipal  governments;  in  some  instances,  in  SHI-funded  systems \n(Israel,  the  Netherlands),  they  are  operated  by  private  not-for-profit \norganizations.  Recently,  in  some  tax-funded  systems  (e.g.,  Sweden), \nprivate  for-profit  chains  have  begun  to  open  nursing  homes  that  are \nfunded  on  a  contract  basis  with  local  municipal  governments.  Costs \nfor nursing home care can be expensive: in Norway, the cost per patient \nis  often  over  $100,000  per  year  in  a  publicly  funded  home,  with  the \npatient  responsible  for  paying  up  to  80%  depending  on  the  family\u2019s \neconomic status. In Sweden, patients living in publicly funded nursing \nhomes in Stockholm County pay a relatively small official fee, but they \nalso  pay  room  rent  and  up  to  2706  Swedish  krona  (SEK)  per  month \n(about $270 U.S. dollars [USD]) for food out of their monthly public \npension payments.\n\nIn 2012, in an effort to reduce demand for expensive hospital and \nnursing  home  services,  Norway  and  Denmark  began  elderly  care \nreforms that shifted service delivery as well as funding responsibilities \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   46\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

Among innovations in Norway, municipal-\nities are required to establish a municipal acute bed unit (MAU) to treat \nstable  elderly  patients  and  provide  observation  beds  for  evaluation. \nPartial funding for these units is provided by the four public regional \nhealth care administrations. Some municipalities have also embedded \nprimary care units inside their regional hospital to arrange discharge \nand to coordinate care for the chronically ill elderly. Norwegian munic-\nipalities are also responsible through their contracted (mostly private) \nprimary care physicians to implement the National Pathways Program, \nwhich established treatment protocols for cross-sector conditions such \nas diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.\n\nA  differently  configured  structural  innovation  to  better  integrate \nLTC  for  the  chronically  ill  elderly  with  clinical  individual  health \nservices  has  been  to  consolidate  both  social  and  health  care  services \nwithin the same public administrative organization. In 2019, as part of \nhealth reforms in Ireland and Denmark and a proposed (unenacted) \nreform  in  Finland,  as  well  as  a  pilot  decentralization  program  in \nEngland for 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester, social and health \ncare programs are to be administered by a single responsible agency.\n\nIn  the  SHI-funded  system  in  the  Netherlands,  almost  7%  of  the \npopulation live in a residential home. National government legislation \nrevised the structure of nursing home funding and care in 2015. Three \nacts  restructured  the  separate  public  LTC  SHI  fund,  which  requires \nmandatory  payments  by  100%  of  Dutch  adults,  and  introduced  \ndelivery-related reforms that reduced the number and overall cost of \nnursing home patients paid for by the fund. Determination of eligibility \nfor  public  payment  for  nursing  home  care  is  now  made  by  an  inde-\npendent national assessment body (the Centre for Needs Assessment). \nMoreover, municipal governments now play a stronger role in funding \nand  delivering  home  care  services.  The  reforms  created  social  care \nteams  that  hold  \u201ckitchen  table  talks\u201d  to  steer  the  elderly  first  toward \nseeking care from family, neighbors, churches, and other local commu-\nnity organizations before they qualify for publicly paid in-home care. \nIn 2012, some 1.5 million people (12% of total population) provided \ninformal care to ill or disabled persons, averaging 22 hours per week \nof care per person.\n\nHome care recipients in the Netherlands can choose to set up a \u201cper-\nsonal budget,\u201d using their public funding allocation to select their pre-\nferred individual care personnel (either publicly employed or publicly \napproved private providers). This arrangement also enables these home \ncare recipients to determine the particular mix of services they want, \nas well as to augment the allocated public funds with personal funds. A \nnumber of innovative not-for-profit nursing homes have been created \nto provide additional services to elderly living in their neighborhood \n(primary care home visits), as well as terminal hospice care (e.g., the \nSaffier De Residentie Groep residences in The Haag).\n\nIn  the  United  States,  nursing  home  and  home  care  are  funded  and \ndelivered in a variety of different ways. For individuals who have minimal \nfinancial assets, nursing home costs are paid by a joint federal-regional \n(state) welfare program called Medicaid. Most state government Medic-\naid programs pay out more than 40% of their total budget for nursing \nhome  care.  In  the  past,  Medicaid  did  not  pay  for  home  care  services. \nHowever, some states have programs with private for-profit and not-for-\nprofit providers that provide home care as a way to forestall the need for \nthe more expensive nursing home care.\n\nMany private individuals take out private LTC insurance, typically \nfrom  commercial  insurance  companies.  These  policies  require  indi-\nviduals to make premium payments for years in advance (often 20 or \nmore) before the individual learns whether they will, in fact, require \nhome  or  nursing  home  care.  Some  private  insurers  have  also  raised \npremiums after individuals have paid in for many years and canceled \npolicies if the new higher rate is not affordable. The 2010 ACA con-\ntained  a  new  public  LTC  insurance  program.  However,  the  program \nwas  designed  to  be  voluntary,  and  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services administrators decided in 2013 not to implement that \nportion of the law.\n\nIn addition to the tax-funded Medicaid program and privately pur-\nchased LTC insurance, many middle-class families pay for care from \nsavings, by selling the elderly person\u2019s home, or by direct contribution \n\nfrom children and other family members. Expenses can reach between \n$60,000 and $100,000 per year depending on the location of a facility \nand who operates it.\n\nNursing home care in the United States is provided by a wide mix \nof private not-for-profit and for-profit providers, ranging from church-\nowned single-site homes to large stock market\u2013listed companies. Many \nof  these  homes  are  purpose-built  as  assisted-living  or  memory-care \nfacilities. Home care services are delivered by a mix of private not-for-\nprofit and for-profit providers.\n\nIn  Japan,  a  national  LTC  insurance  fund  was  introduced  in \n2000.  Although  the  new  fund  applies  uniformly  across  the  country,  \nthe program is administered by municipal governments and the pre-\nmium  level  differs  across  municipalities,  with  an  average  monthly \npremium of 3000 yen (about $30 USD). In South Korea, an SHI fund \nfor LTC is funded by mandatory contributions of 4.78% of a person\u2019s \nregular national health insurance contribution, with an additional 20% \nof total LTC expenditures provided by national government funds. The \nclient copayment for home care is set at 15% of expenses and at 20% \nfor residential care.\n\n \u25a0 PHARMACEUTICALS\nPharmaceutical  expenditures  in  developed  countries  (inpatient  and \noutpatient combined) vary widely across different health system types, \nas  well  as  between  different  countries  within  each  institutional  type. \nOECD figures for 2018 show drug expenditures in tax-funded coun-\ntries in Western Europe ranging from 6.3% of total health expenditures \n(THE) in Denmark to 11.9% of THE in the United Kingdom and 18.6% \nof THE in Spain. In SHI-funded Western European systems, pharma-\nceuticals absorbed 7.5% of THE in the Netherlands, while in Germany, \nthat figure was 14.1%. In the hybrid tax-funded SHI systems of Central \nEurope,  the  pharmaceutical  percentage  of  THE  is  higher:  18.2%  of \nTHE in Estonia to 27.9% of THE in Hungary. Similarly, in Asian SHI \nsystems, pharmaceuticals consumed 20.7% of THE in South Korea and \n18.6% of THE in Japan. The OECD\u2019s 2018 figures for pharmaceutical \nspending in North America are 12.0% of THE in the United States and \n16.7% in Canada.\n\nContributing  factors  to  this  wide-ranging  variation  are  (1)  differ-\nences in national practice and prescription patterns reflecting differing \ncultural  expectations;  (2)  the  ratio  problem  (relatively  fixed  level  of \npharmaceutical  costs  due  to  international  prices\u2014the  numerator\u2014\ndivided  by  a  greatly  varying  per  capita  health  expenditure  cost  in \ndifferent developed country health systems); (3) the range and type of \npharmaceutical price controls in each country; and (4) the degree of \nlimitation placed on pharmaceutical supply, tied to formularies and/or \nexplicit forms of drug rationing.\n\nMost European health systems have tight national controls on the \ncost and, in some tax-based countries, on the availability of pharma-\nceuticals. Most European countries also use a number of different regu-\nlatory measures to limit prices and/or availability of both inpatient and \noutpatient  drugs,  including  mandatory  generic  prescribing,  reference \npricing, patient copays (sometimes with an annual ceiling, after which \ncopayments  are  no  longer  required),  and  (particularly  in  tax-funded \nsystems)  national  formularies  tied  to  clinical  effectiveness.  Norway, \nfor example, allows only about 2300 different preparations\u2014including \ndosage, delivery method, and box size\u2014to be stocked by pharmacies. \nPrices  for  drugs  can  vary  considerably  across  different  European \ncountries,  tied  to  economic  development  and  domestic  pricing  pat-\nterns. One consequence of these differential national pricing controls \nhas been the development of a parallel import market, in which drug \nwholesalers and pharmacists in the more expensive countries purchase \nsupplies from a cheaper market elsewhere in Europe.\n\nAccess  to  expensive  drugs  has  also  been  intentionally  limited  in \nsome tax-funded health systems in Europe. One basis for rationing has \nbeen  rationing  tied  to  quality-adjusted  life-years  (QALYs).  Rationing \nalso reflects a clash between strained public drug budgets and public \npressure.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  cancer  drugs  in  England,  the \nrecommendation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-\nlence  (NICE)  against  funding  the  breast  cancer  drug  trastuzumab \n(Herceptin)  was  subsequently  overturned  by  the  Minister  of  Health. \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   47\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

These  sales  also  served  to  supplement  their  income  in  a \nsetting of relatively low per-visit payments from state-run SHI funds. \nConcerned about cost and overuse, both Taiwan (in 1997, except for \nemergency  cases  or  rural  regions)  and  South  Korea  (for  the  whole \ncountry in 2003) implemented \u201cseparation reforms,\u201d which ended these \nphysician  sales.  In  Japan,  a  series  of  fee  and  reimbursement  reforms \nhave trimmed the percentage of all prescriptions dispensed in 2016 by \nphysicians to 26% of prescriptions filled.\n \u25a0 GOVERNANCE AND REGULATION\nHealth  care  services  in  developed  countries  are  steered,  constrained, \nmonitored,  and  (to  varying  degrees)  assessed  by  governments  and \ngovernmentally established and/or empowered bodies. Although these \nmeasures apply particularly to the financial efficiency of government-\nfunded  services,  they  also  seek  to  promote  patient  and  community \nsafety, equity of access, and high-quality clinical outcomes. This over-\nsight  is  often  strongly  focused  on  privately  operated  and  contracted \nproviders  and  insurers,  although  in  principle,  it  applies  to  publicly \noperated organizations as well.\n\nGovernance  consists  of  macro  national-level  policy,  meso  \ninstitutional-level management, and micro clinic-level care decisions. \nThis  complex  mix  of  governance  decisions  is  often  shared  among \ndifferent national, regional, and local governments, depending on the \ndegree of centralization, decentralization, or, recently, recentralization \n(e.g., Norway and Denmark). While most systems officially prioritize \n\u201cgood  governance,\u201d  governance  activities  frequently  comingle  with \npolitical  objectives  as  core  policy  concepts  are  developed  and  trans-\nformed into concrete organizational targets.\n\nIn  Sweden,  health  system  governance  is  shared  among  national, \nregional (county), and local municipal governments. The national gov-\nernment has responsibility to pass \u201cframe\u201d legislation, which establishes \nthe basic structure of the system. To cite one example, until recently, the \nnational  government  had  limited  an  adult  patient\u2019s  total  copayments \nfor outpatient physician care (specialist and primary care) and pharma-\nceuticals to 2800 SEK (about $280 USD) for a 12-month period. The \n20  regional  governments,  in  turn,  made  policy  decisions  within  that \nlegislation, deciding how to apportion the specific copayments for each \nprimary care and specialist outpatient visit. Since Swedes can self-refer \nto specialists, some counties double the copayment to hospital-based \ndoctors to discourage unnecessary appointments. Similarly, fiscal pol-\nicy normally is shared between the regional government, which raises \nabout 70% of total health expenditures through its own county-set flat \nincome tax, and the national government, which provides additional \npurpose-tied funds for national objectives such as consolidating open-\nheart  surgery  across  county  lines  as  well  as  supplementing  lower  tax \nreceipts in rural counties with smaller working populations. However, \nthis  normal  funding  relationship  across  governments  can  change.  In \nthe  early  1990s,  the  national  government  placed  a  \u201cstop\u201d  on  raising \ncounty taxes prior to Sweden\u2019s admission in 1995 to the EU. In 2016, \neach of the 20 counties could set their own ceilings, which were almost \nall at 3300 SEK (about $330 USD).\n\nIn Spain\u2019s tax-funded health system (71.1% publicly funded in 2015), \n17  regional  \u201cautonomous  communities\u201d  were  given  full  managerial \nresponsibility for the provision of health services in a 1990s decentral-\nization process, along with ownership of all publicly operated hospitals. \nThe national government generates a substantial proportion of health \ncare resources, which are included in the broad block grants it allocates \nto the regional governments, which then add regional tax revenue to \nmake up the full public sector budget. In a mechanism to steer regional \ngovernment operating policies in this decentralized environment, the \nnational Spanish government established a joint federal-regional coun-\ncil to review quality and performance data (through the 2003 Health \n\nSystem  Cohesion  and  Quality  Act).  Italy\u2019s  tax-funded  health  system \n(75.8% publicly funded in 2014) similarly shares governance responsi-\nbilities between national and regional governments. Health services are \nprovided by local health authorities (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) super-\nvised by 20 regional governments within a nationally established gover-\nnance framework, financed through a complicated mix of national and \nnationally  stipulated  but  regionally  collected  taxes.  Again,  like  Spain, \nthe  national  government  established  a  federal-regional  government \ncouncil,  seeking  to  better  coordinate  care  standards  and  information \namong the regions and with national government agencies. In 2006, the \nnational government imposed strict financial plans on 10 regions that \nwere systematically in deficit.\n\nIn  Germany,  where  funding  for  its  SHI-based  health  system  is \npredominantly  the  responsibility  of  120  private  not-for-profit  sick-\nness  funds,  governance  decisions  are  shared  among  these  private \nsector sickness funds and public sector national, regional, and munic-\nipal  governments.  The  sickness  funds  receive  a  risk-adjusted  pre-\nmium  payment  for  each  enrolled  individual,  according  to  a  national  \ngovernment\u2013determined  formula,  and  from  a  national  government\u2013\nrun health insurance pool. Most hospitals are owned and operated by \nmunicipal governments, while investment capital for structural renova-\ntions and new building comes from the 16 regional L\u00e4nder taken from \ntheir tax revenues. Payment frameworks and amounts for public hos-\npitals are negotiated between associations of these municipally owned \nhospitals and associations of the private sickness funds, without formal \ngovernment participation.\n\nRegulation is an essential element of an effective health care system \nand a key component of overall health system governance. Regulation \nincorporates both broad standard requirements that affect all organi-\nzations  that  operate  in  a  country  (e.g.,  hiring,  firing,  and  wage  deci-\nsions) as well as specific health sector\u2013related regulations (e.g., proper \nhandling, use, and disposal of low-grade nuclear waste from radiation \ntreatments).  Recent  examples  of  health  sector  regulation  in  England, \nfor example, include the following:\n\n1.  Requiring all cancer drugs adopted for use in the NHS to cost no \n\nmore than $41,268/QALY;\n\n2.  Requiring in their employment contract that junior doctors in hos-\n\npitals work a specific number of Sundays; and\n\n3.  Requiring  that  all  emergency  department  patients  receive  care \n\nwithin 4 h of their arrival.\n\nA powerful tool that has the force of law, regulation can have sub-\nstantial  negative  as  well  as  positive  effects.  A  well-known  political \nscience  corollary  of  regulatory  power  is  that  \u201cthe  right  to  regulate  is \nalso the right to destroy.\u201d For example, in the United States, the federal \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, as part of its pursuit of cleaner air, \nissued wide-ranging regulatory orders setting performance standards \nthat resulted in the closing of many West Virginia coal mines, with the \nloss of tens of millions of dollars of productive capacity and thousands \nof  high-paying  jobs,  and  likely  contributing  to  social  conditions  that \nhelped  spawn  that  state\u2019s  high  rates  of  opioid  abuse  among  unem-\nployed  males.  Similarly,  in  some  tax-funded  European  systems,  such \nas those in Sweden and England, there is growing pressure from public \nhealth advocates for national regulations to prohibit the making of a \nprofit from publicly paid funds. In Sweden, the national government\u2019s \nReepalu report in 2016 honored a pledge made by the Social Demo-\ncratic government to its Left (socialist) Party ally by calling for a legis-\nlated ban on profit-making in the provision of publicly funded health \ncare services. The report\u2019s publication triggered substantial divestment \nof existing investor-owned primary care, nursing home, and home care \ncompanies.\n\n \u25a0 FUTURE CHALLENGES\nHealth  systems  in  developed  countries  face  continued  challenges  in \nthe coming years. These include financial, organizational, and policy \ndilemmas for which institutionally viable, financially sustainable, and \npolitically  supportable  solutions  will  be  complicated  to  develop  and \ndifficult to implement. On the delivery side, a key question is whether \n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   48\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\nPART 1The Profession of Medicine"

    "text": "privately structured GP-based primary care is more efficient and effec-\ntive than various clinic-based forms of primary care services. Recent \nmovement in Northern and Central Europe toward more private GPs, \nalong  with  continued  private  office\u2013based  primary  care  in  much  of \nCanada,  the  United  States,  and  economically  developed  countries  in \nAsia, raises complex policy issues for international organizations like \nthe World Health Organization (WHO), as well as national policymak-\ners. In the hospital sector, existing levels of clinical quality and patient \nresponsiveness in publicly operated command-and-control institutions \nwill increasingly have to compete with those of semi-autonomous pub-\nlic hospitals, as well as various types of private, sometimes very inno-\nvative providers. In the financing arena, continued pressure on publicly \nraised health system revenues is likely to erode longtime commitments \nin some tax-funded health systems to minimal patient copayments and \nlow out-of-pocket funding.\n\nAn additional set of challenges will arise from recent commitments \nby international organizations like WHO to restructure health systems \nin  developed  countries  to  better  address  the  social  determinants  of \nhealth. This new, incomplete strategy calls for a dramatic expansion of \nhealth sector responsibility to include a wide range of existing institu-\ntional  arrangements  in  housing,  education,  work-life,  and  social  and \npolitical  decision-making.  The  influential  2010  Strategic  Review  of \nHealth  Inequalities  in  England  entitled  \u201cFair  Society,  Healthy  Lives,\u201d \nled  by  Sir  Michael  Marmot,  a  British  epidemiologist,  called  for  the \nelimination of all \u201cinequities in power, money, and resources.\u201d Separate \nfrom  the  political  dimensions  of  this  proposed  new  paradigm,  how \nsuch fundamental societal change will be funded and implemented has \nyet to be addressed.\n\nLooking forward, among the most essential challenges to national \ndecision-makers in the coming period will be four specific health sys-\ntem imperatives:\n\n1.  Finding a more sustainable balance between ethics and funding.\nPolicymakers  in  publicly  funded  health  systems  face  a  growing \ngap between patient expectations of high-quality clinical care, staff \nexpectations of better compensation, and the economic imperative \nof  no  new  taxes.  Recent  research  has  suggested  that  SHI-funded \nhealth systems, faced with increasing aging and thus proportionally \nfewer  employed,  face  a  similar  gap.  While  the  present  solidaristic \nfoundation  for  raising  collective  revenues  is  insufficient,  available \nnonsolidaristic tools (copayments, supplemental insurance, private \npay) inevitably contribute to overall inequality. But what then are the \nrealistic policy alternatives? The minimalist new policy goal neces-\nsarily will have to become one of raising new revenues while doing \nthe least economic and social harm.\n\n2.  Developing better strategies to steer provider diversity.\n\nHealth systems in developed countries are becoming more diverse \nwith more and different types of public owners: hospital trusts, state \nenterprises,  and  mixed  public-private  hospital  owners/managers. \nThere also are more and different types of private providers: not-for-\nprofit community groups, foundations, and cooperatives, as well as \nfor-profit small local entrepreneurs, large international companies, \nand risk capital funds (venture capital). Furthermore, new innova-\ntive delivery models are reorganizing traditional service boundaries: \nnot-for-profit private nursing homes in the Netherlands also provide \noutpatient  primary  care  to  neighborhood  elderly  patients,  as  well \nas  hospice  care;  Israeli  technology  companies  combine  high-tech \nhome-based  patient  monitoring  with  standard  medical  and  cus-\ntodial  home  care  services.  Public  pressure  from  citizens  for  more \nchoice and better outcomes will pressure policymakers toward new, \nmore accommodative health system arrangements. A 2019 national \ngovernment report in Sweden on the hospital sector recommended \na new emphasis on better access to out-of-office hours and out-of- \nhospital acute care by private as well as public providers.\n\n3.  Ensuring better coordination between social and health services.\nTax-funded and SHI-funded systems alike are under intense policy \npressure  to  develop  better  strategies  to  integrate  services  for  the \nchronically  ill  elderly,  as  a  way  to  improve  the  quality  of  services \nthat these patients receive and to keep them at home healthier and \n\nlonger, reducing expensive acute visits to hospitals and emergency \ndepartments. The clear delivery system goal will increasingly be to \nkeep the elderly out of nursing homes and acute care facilities for as \nlong as possible.\n\n49\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n7\n\nG\nl\no\nb\na\nl\n\nD\ni\nv\ne\nr\ns\ni\nt\ny\no\nf\n\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\nS\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\nF\ni\nn\na\nn\nc\ni\nn\ng\na\nn\nd\nD\ne\nl\ni\nv\ne\nr\ny\n\n4.  Building labor unions into provider innovation.\n\nIn many developed countries, health sector staff, including hospital \nphysicians,  are  members  of  labor  unions.  Effective  policymaking \nwill  require  finding  mechanisms  to  build  these  personnel  unions \ninto accelerated health system restructuring processes. This process \nwill  necessarily  involve  integrating  unions  into  more  innovative, \nflexible, fiscally sustainable organizational arrangements with con-\ntracts  that  reward  active  participation  in  organizational  change, \ncontracts that pay incentives to more productive employees, quicker \nreassignment  and  redundancy  procedures  (firing  health  sector \nworkers can take a year or longer in some European health systems), \nand  establishing  profit-sharing  payments  to  teams/unions,  also  in \npublic sector organizations.\n\nWhile the structure and complexity of resolving these specific orga-\nnizational challenges will vary depending on a country\u2019s cultural and \ninstitutional context, the commonality of these problems suggests that \nhealth systems in the developed world require a new, broader range of \ntargeted policy strategies and solutions.\n \u25a0 FINANCING AND PROVIDING HEALTH SERVICES \nIN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (See also Chap. 474)\nHealth systems in developing countries reflect a complex combination \nof the same core elements found in developed country systems (hospi-\ntals, primary care facilities, medical staff, pharmaceuticals) adapted to \ndifferent, widely varying organizational, social, political, and economic \ncontexts  and  conditions.  System  structure  and  provider  institutions \ntypically vary by differing national characteristics including historical \nrelationships  (Anglophone/Francophone/Hispanic/Soviet  Semashko/\nAmerican  institutional  and  educational  links);  GDP  and  per  capita \nannual national income (low- or middle-income developing countries); \npolitical norms and values; and ethnic and/or cultural mix. Predomi-\nnantly  public  sector  funding,  particularly  in  lower-income  countries, \ntypically  generates  substantially  lower  levels  of  resources  per  capita \nthan in developed countries and tends to be less reliable, particularly \nin countries where the economy is dependent on commodity exports.\nService  delivery  arrangements  in  developing  countries,  in  turn, \ntypically  have  higher  provider-to-population  ratios  as  well  as,  in \npublic sector institutions, more mixed quality of care. In a number of \nmiddle-income  developing  countries,  migration  of  trained  medical \nstaff  to  practice  in  higher-paying  developed  country  health  systems \n(often  going  to  countries  with  historical  relationships  and/or  where \nthey  received  advanced  training)  further  depletes  available  medical \nresources.  In  nearly  all  developing  countries,  private  sector  provid-\ners  play  an  important  supplemental  role,  with  some  middle-income \ndeveloping  countries  like  China  currently  encouraging  their  further \ndevelopment.\n\nMost  middle-  and  lower-income  developing  countries  struggle  to \nfund high-quality individual health services. Recent emphasis on uni-\nversal health coverage has intensified that struggle. In middle-income \ndeveloping  countries  (Table  7-3),  World  Bank  data  from  2016  show \n\nTABLE 7-3  Middle-Income Developing Countries: Total Health \nExpenditure (% of gross domestic product)\nMiddle-Income Developing Countries\n\nKazakhstan\nThailand\nMalaysia\nTurkey\nChina\nBotswana\nMexico\nColombia\n\n3.53%\n3.71%\n3.80%\n4.31%\n4.98%\n5.46%\n5.47%\n5.91%\n\nHPIM21e_Part1_p001-p090.indd   49\n\n19/01/22   1:52 PM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Total health spending in low-income develop-\ning countries (Table 7-4) ranges from 3.65% of GDP for Nigeria, 3.66% \nfor India, 3.97% for Ethiopia, 6.29% for Nepal, to 8.40% for Honduras.\nGiven lower aggregate GDP levels, per capita annual expenditures \nare  considerably  less  than  those  found  in  developed  countries.  In  \nmiddle-income developing countries (Table 7-5), Thailand spent (2016 \ndata  in  adjusted  USD)  $221  annually  per  person,  Kazakhstan  spent \n$262, Colombia spent $340, Malaysia spent $361, Botswana spent $379, \nChina spent $398, Mexico spent $461, and Turkey spent $468. Among \nlow-income developing countries (Table 7-6), Ethiopia spent $27 per \nperson annually, Nepal spent $45, India spent $62, and Nigeria spent \n$79, whereas Honduras spent $199.\n\nChina  provides  an  interesting  example  of  financing  and  service \ndelivery development in middle-income developing countries. Financ-\ning  reforms  replaced  fully  publicly  funded  services  with  three  new \narrangements tied to work status and residence: (1) Urban Employee \nBasic Medical Insurance in 1998 (incorporating privately funded med-\nical  savings  accounts\u2014a  concept  pioneered  in  Singapore);  (2)  Urban \nResident Basic Medical Insurance in 2007; and (3) New Rural Coop-\nerative Medical Scheme in 2007. The urban employee program is an \nSHI model reflecting the rapid rate of economic growth and increasing \nincomes for urban workers. Starting in 2013, the Chinese government \nincreasingly emphasized the development of new private hospitals and \npromotion of private insurance in urban areas. These and other health \nsector reforms became possible as continued strong economic growth \nover 30 years raised an estimated 300 million Chinese into the middle \nclass,  generating  the  requisite  private  as  well  as  public  revenues  to \nunderpin major structural health sector change.\n\nService  delivery  in  developing  countries  varies  widely  in  access, \nquality, and outcomes across and also within many developing coun-\ntries. Medical services and tertiary institutions in urban areas of China, \nfor example, operate at a substantially higher standard of service than \nthose  typically  available  in  poorer  rural  regions.  Similar  disparities \nexist in wealthier parts of India such as Rajasthan, whereas in poorer \nstates  such  as  Bihar,  primary  care  is  mostly  delivered  by  community \n\u201cvolunteers\u201d with basic medical training, supervised by a GP.\n\nTwo  critical  challenges  for  all  developing  country  health  systems \nare contingent on generating adequate future funding flows. First, the \ncurrent push from United Nations agencies to achieve universal health \ncoverage  will  require  additional  public  and  private  sector  funding  to \n\nTABLE 7-5  Middle-Income Developing Countries: Per Capita Health \nExpenditures\nMiddle-Income Developing Countries\n\nThailand\nKazakhstan\nColombia\nMalaysia\nBotswana\nChina\nMexico\nTurkey\n\n$221\n$262\n$340\n$361\n$379\n$398\n$461\n$468\n\npay  for  the  necessary  new  providers  and  services.  Second,  available \nfunding will need to be more effectively targeted on needed and appro-\npriate services, with minimized managerial inefficiencies and substan-\ntially less political corruption.\n\nBoth  forms  of  expanded  funding  will  be  dependent  on  strong \nnational and global economic growth, which in turn will require con-\ntinued country-level economic and political reforms. Achieving both \nfunding-related  objectives  will  require  considerable  international  as \nwell as national effort.\n \u25a0 FURTHER READING\nBarber  SL  et  al:  Price  Setting  and  Price  Regulation  in  Health  Care: \nLessons  for  Advancing  Universal  Health  Coverage.

Bates \n\nSafety and quality are two of the central dimensions of health care. In \nrecent  years,  it  has  become  easier  to  measure  safety  and  quality,  and \nit is increasingly clear that performance in both dimensions could be \nmuch better. The public is\u2014with good justification\u2014demanding mea-\nsurement and accountability, and payment for services will increasingly \nbe based on performance in these areas. Thus, physicians must learn \nabout these two domains, how they can be improved, and the relative \nstrengths and limitations of the current ability to measure them.\n\nSafety and quality are closely related but do not completely overlap. \nThe Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series of reports \nthat  safety  is  the  first  part  of  quality  and  that  the  health  care  system \nmust first and foremost guarantee that it will deliver safe care, although \nquality  is  also  pivotal.
