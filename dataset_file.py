        """ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
The gastrointestinal (GI) tract extends from the mouth to the anus
and is composed of organs with distinct functions. Sphincters that
assist in gut compartmentalization separate the organs. The gut wall is
organized into distinct layers that contribute to regional activities. The
mucosa is a barrier to luminal contents or a site for fluid and nutrient
transfer. Smooth muscle in association with the enteric nervous system
mediates propulsion between regions. Many GI organs possess a serosal layer that provides a supportive foundation and permits external
input.
Interactions with other systems serve the needs of the gut and the
body. Pancreaticobiliary conduits deliver bile and enzymes into the
duodenum. The vascular supply is modulated by GI activity. Lymphatic
channels assist in gut immune activities. Intrinsic nerves provide the
controls for propulsion and fluid regulation. Extrinsic neural input
provides volitional or involuntary control that is specific for each gut
region.""",

        "text": """FUNCTIONS OF THE GI TRACT
The GI tract serves two main functions—assimilating nutrients and
eliminating waste. In the mouth, food is processed, mixed with salivary
amylase, and delivered to the gut lumen. The esophagus propels the
bolus into the stomach; the lower esophageal sphincter prevents oral
reflux of gastric contents. The squamous esophageal mucosa protects
against significant diffusion or absorption. Aboral esophageal contractions coordinate with relaxation of the upper and lower esophageal
sphincters on swallowing.
The stomach triturates and mixes the food bolus with pepsin and
acid. Gastric acid also sterilizes the upper gut. The proximal stomach
serves a storage function by relaxing to accommodate the meal. Phasic
contractions in the distal stomach propel food residue against the pylorus, where it is ground and thrust proximally for further mixing before
it is emptied into the duodenum. The stomach secretes intrinsic factor
for vitamin B
12 absorption.
Most nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. The mucosal
villus architecture provides maximal surface area for absorption and is
endowed with specialized enzymes and transporters. Triturated food
from the stomach mixes with pancreatic juice and bile in the duodenum. Pancreatic juice contains enzymes for nutrient digestion and
bicarbonate to optimize the pH for enzyme activation. Bile secreted
by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is essential for lipid digestion. The proximal intestine is optimized for rapid absorption of most
nutrients and minerals, whereas the ileum is better suited for absorbing
vitamin B
12 and bile acids. Bile contains by-products of erythrocyte
degradation, toxins, medications, and cholesterol for fecal evacuation.
Intestinal motor function delivers indigestible residue into the colon
for processing. The ileocecal junction is a sphincter that prevents
coloileal reflux, reducing microbial density.
The colon prepares waste for evacuation. The mucosa dehydrates
the stool, reducing daily ileal volumes of 1000–1500 mL to 100–200 mL
expelled from the rectum. The colon possesses a dense bacterial colonization that ferments undigested carbohydrates and short-chain fatty
acids. The gut microbiome also modulates immune and physiologic
activity. Esophageal transit takes seconds, and times in the stomach and
small intestine range from minutes to a few hours, but colon propagation requires >1 day in most individuals. Colon contractions exhibit
a to-and-fro character that promotes fecal desiccation. The proximal
colon mixes and absorbs fluid, while the distal colon exhibits peristaltic
contractions and mass movements to expel the stool. The colon terminates in the anus, which possesses volitional and involuntary controls
to permit fecal retention until it can be released in a convenient setting""",

        "text": """EXTRINSIC MODULATION OF GUT
FUNCTION
GI function is modified by influences outside the gut. Unlike other
organs, the gut is in continuity with the outside environment. Protective mechanisms are vigilant against injury from foods, medications,
toxins, and microbes. Mucosal immune mechanisms include epithelial
and lamina propria lymphocytes and plasma cells supported by lymph
node chains to prevent noxious agents from entering the circulation.
Antimicrobial peptides secreted by Paneth cells defend against pathogens. Drugs and toxins absorbed into the bloodstream are filtered
and detoxified in the liver via the portal venous circulation. Although
intrinsic nerves control most basic gut activities, extrinsic neural input
modulates many functions. Many GI reflexes involve extrinsic vagus
or splanchnic nerve pathways. The brain-gut axis alters function in
regions not under volitional regulation. Stress can disrupt gut motor,
secretory, and sensory function.""",
